Most of you are familiar with the reddiquette, which is an informal expression of the values of many redditors, as written by redditors themselves. For those who are not, see this page: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette. Some things to keep in mind before you post here are: 

* **Remember the human.** When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?"" Basically, adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.

* **Read the rules of a community before making a submission**. Do read our rules here: https://www.reddit.com/r/India/wiki/rules and make note especially of the rules concerning hate speech, personal attacks, and disallowed content. Note that new accounts will face comment moderation, i.e. your comment may not appear until it has been reviewed by mods. 

* **Read the reddiquette.** Read it again every once in a while. Reddiquette is a living, breathing, working document which may change over time as the community faces new problems in its growth. https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette

* **Constructive criticism**: Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.

* **Spam**: Report any spam you find. 

* **Abuse**: Please report any comment that you feel is derailing the conversation or hampering it in any way. Use the report button. Don't engage in flame wars or trolling. Try and keep the discussion on track.

* **Reputable sources:** Please only post information that you have come across that is from reputable sources. There is a lot of information from unreputable sources circulating, especially on social media. Users are forewarned that people dealing in information from unreputable sources will be banned. For a guide on what constitutes a reputable source, take a look at our rules wiki here: https://www.reddit.com/r/India/wiki/rules#wiki_reputed_and_verified_content
","[R] Megathread III: India-Pakistan Border Skirmish","Please provide legit sources for all updates and information, **no unverified twitter handles/websites**. 

**Reposts of all links will be removed and directed to this sticky thread.**

Most importantly, please **be civil, no hate speech or personal attacks, don't feed the trolls or resort to petty name-calling**. Its a sensitive time and we need to be better than our usual selves.

I've been closely following the news, the claims, the debunking of claims etc, and I think that I have a theory on what exactly happened in the air engagement that let to the Indian pilot's capture.


First of all, though, you need to bear in my mind that in war no government or military (including India's AND Pakistan's) always speaks 100% truthfully for 3 different reasons.

1.	`They actually believe that what they are saying is correct, at the time that they said it. This is especially true in air-to-air combat, where in every war in history  all sides claim to have shot down more planes than were actually shot down. Air combat can be confusing due to the speeds and distances involved.
2.	`They are trying to protect military operational secrets, so tell lies publically in order to maintain a military secret. A good example of this was in the 1991 Gulf War, where the US and Saudi kept claiming that almost all the Iraqi Scud missiles were successfully intercepted by Patriot missiles, in order to get Iraq to stop trying to fire the missiles. The reality was that the Patriots only hit a minority of incoming missiles.
3.	`They know that don't know the truth for sure, but go with whatever information they have if that information helps with the morale of their own fighting forces and civilians. This is why, for example, in WW2 many pilots would get credit the kills they claimed even when solid proof was missing.


OK, so with that said, what do we know about the aerial engagement?

Pakistan said that Indian planes chasing its retaliatory strike entered Pakistani space. Initially Pakistan claimed 2 planes were shot down, one pilot in custody and one in hospital. Pakistan later officially changed that to one plane (Mig-21) and one pilot

India agreed that they chased the strike, said immediately that they were chasing F-16s, and claimed to have shot down one of them.

Pakistan denied using F-16s in the operation, said it was JF-17s. India then 2 days later claimed they had electronic signatures data indicating F-16s were involved, and then produced wreckage from an AMRAAM AIM-120 C-5 missile, saying that F-16s are the only planes in South Asia than can fire that missile.


Ok, now lets look at the actual evidence.

Mig-21 shot down - Solid proof. Photos and video of the wreck and pilot as evidence.

2nd Indian plane shot down - no evidence, but Pakistan officially stopped claiming this

F-16 shot down - no evidence, all the photo evidence India claimed has now been proven false by third-party experts.

F-16s involved - the AIM-120 wreckage is pretty damning. Initial claims that it was sold to Taiwan have been denied by Taiwan, and US-based experts have said that the overall sale package that include the missile covered both Taiwan and Pakistan, so the missile is likely to have been sold to Pakistan. HOWEVER, the AIM-120 is a long-range missile (over 100km / 60 mile) range and is not a missile that Pakistan would use in a close range encounter like the one that India claimed occured (India said they fired a R-73 heat seeking missiles, which has a 30km/20 mile range).

The AMRAAM is very unlikely to have been fired from a JF-17. The information saying that the JF-17 could fire them is very old (from around 2008) and all recent information says that they only fire the Chinese version of the missile instead. An AMRAAM could not be fired from a plane with a Chinese radar like the JF-17 does (missiles are compatible only with the radar systems they were built for).


Ok, so how do you reconcile all this? My theory which fits the available evidence is below.


Pakistan had a plan to retaliate by dropping bombs in Indian Kashmir. Mission profile: JF-17s as strike element crossing into Indian Airspace. F-16s were used as long-distance escort, using long-range AIM-120 missiles from safely deep inside Pakistani airspace.  JF-17s dropped bombs just before the Indian Migs were in interception range. They turned round and burned hard for Pakistani space.  The Mig-21s chased them hard and are faster than JF-17s, almost catching them before hitting the border. The Indian Wing Commander made the call to do a hot pursuit. That brought them in range to fire R-73 missiles .  JF-17s used flares to evade the missiles but since the missiles still detonated close enough to the Pakistani planes that it looked like a kill to the Indian pilots. The JF-17 from a distance looks a lot like a F-16 and could be visually confused (more on this later).

But at the same time once the Indians were in Pakistani space, the F-16s at range fired at least one AMRAAM taking out a Mig-21 . Either wreckage from that missiles was carried into India by inertia, or more likely a second AMRAAM missed its target (perhaps because the second MIG was diving away while using countermeasures) and ended in India.  It's why Pakistan initially though it got 2 planes (1 kill and then one missile fired, resulting in the target rapidly losing altitude) and why India thought it got 1 kill.  It also explains why the AMRAAM part ended in India, and explains why Pakistani denied the use of F-16s (not trying to give away that they use long-range AMRAAM missiles to cover the escape of strike planes)

The Indian plane that got away would have brought with it electronic data showing that it was getting ""painted"" by the kind of radar that the F-16 carries. This, together with the easy-to-confuse misidentification of the JF-17 with an F-16, would have led India to be convinced that they were only fighting F-16s and not JF-17s like they actually were.

As for the issue of why Pakistan initially claimed one pilot in custody and one in hospital, that is simple. ISPR at the time had 3 pieces on information to work into an immediate press release. 1) At the time, Pakistan claimed to have shot down 2 planes. 2) An Indian pilot was reported to have been taken into custody. 3) An Indian pilot was at a hospital getting treated. At the time ISPR had to make a statement, it was not clear to them that the Indian pilot taken into custody was then taken to hospital and was thus the same pilot they reported to be in hospital. Since they thought there were 2 different Indian pilots, that fitted well with the claims they had at the time of 2 planes being shot down.","[R] Megathread III: India-Pakistan Border Skirmish","Please provide legit sources for all updates and information, **no unverified twitter handles/websites**.

2. You say the JF-17 deployed flares even though its entirely possible that the R73 must have hit the jet.
3. Air surveillance in such sensitive zones can tell with  certainty what hit who.
4. You are assuming that Pakistan's Air Force was there to just violate the Indian Air Space and bomb non military installation, however its entirely possible Pakistan had a full blown Air Assault in mind against the Indian Army's forward posts. In that case I don't think F16 would have done a better job from Pakistani Air Space.
5. You are also not making sense with electronic data. Even though they were 2nd Gen aircraft the radar and other technology are kept up to date by Air Force standards. India's Joint Chiefs said they only lost a MIG-21 but some people saw two pilots eject from another jet. That could have been the F16.

In the larger scheme of things, India called the nuclear bluff and attacked Pak territory in response to a terrorist attack that they believe - and the organization JeM took responsibility for - was organized in Pakistan. Will this happen again if there is another attack - I believe so.

for people posting this as some sort ""proof"" of IAF bombs in JeM camps. 

just know that he is addressing people. this is not a interview or anything. he is addressing people and pretty clearly trying to recruit them to his cause of kashmiri jihad by playing the victim saying they crossed our border, attacked something holy like madressa and left etc.. which is true, india did target it as it was in the same area, most people reported that bomb missed by few km. india officials themselves claim that they targeted them so theres no 2 ways about that. they were the target. 

my point is if india can't give any proof and has to reference azhar mehmood's brother loose statement that he made during a conference. that's very tragic, don't you think? 

would you believe anything else azhar mehmood's brother says? or only when it fits your narrative then he's right, otherwise wrong? 

as far as actual proof goes - so far satellite imagery that was conducted independently showed no signs of any building being demolished. that is something pakistan nor india nor JeM can influence. also all the international news that went there reported the same but you can call it bias so lets look towards any satellite proof as that is the best one.

Point is Pakistan govt and media can keep denying Osama killing, Surgical strike, air strike, F16 forever but that doesn't change the truth for rest of the world.

International media like CNN, BBC are famously associated with certain ideology. I personally find most stories of NYT and WSJ fair and neutral. It is not in business interest of many countries and parties that India, Pakistan become friends and grow together.

Only handful of local journalists visited place and that too under heavy military restrictions. They must have shown places around where there was not much collateral damage.

Remember reports were coming out from local journalists that  they cordoned off the madarasa area immediately and did not let anyone enter not even local police.

I think had there been visit from swarm of international journalists they could not have stood the pressure and journalists would have demanded unfettered access to the site. Refusal to do so would have resulted in negative international press coverage.

Both are not mutually exclusive. The Mig21 bison is heavily upgraded with the following - 

- Russian X-band pulse Doppler radar with slotted array
- Russian IRST
- European INS and GPS
- European MFD
- Israeli HUD
- New indigenous RWR
- Stores management system
- Air data computer
- Helmet mounted sight
- New comms/radios
- New canopy (for better pilot visibility)
- Ability to fire the R-77 BVRAAM and R-73 WVRAAM

In short, its instantaneous turn rate and acceleration, and the helmet mounted sight combined with R-73 air-to-air missiles make it very effective at close range encounters and interceptions, even against 4.5 gen aircraft. It also has a tremendous advantage because of its low radar visibility. However there is no getting around the fact that its design is obsolete now and it is limited by the capacity of its airframe and needs to be phased out.

&gt; Is it a 100% given that a Rafale couldn't have been shot down?

Nothing is ever certain in dogfighting but rafale is clearly a vastly superior multirole aircraft. 

&gt; What result is he talking about?

Am assuming he is talking about the loss of our Mig-21 and capture of our pilot. And yes, a more modern aircraft will most likely have improved our chances of success, maybe avoiding the capture of our pilot.","[R] Megathread III: India-Pakistan Border Skirmish","Please provide legit sources for all updates and information, **no unverified twitter handles/websites**.

This ain't propaganda, this is proof. And now I hope you remember 2016 when PAkistan made a big hue and cry about how no strikes happened. That was for 2 reasons which still hold true today

It dents the image of the Pakistani armed forces and pisses off the Mullahs who feel that they weren't properly defended by the army and makes them decide to attack the army.

It increases the pressure on the army to respond against India, especially if they actually release evidence of dead bodies and blown up buildings.

That is why the Pakistani army would rather lie to their public about it. 

And no, most Indians aren't going to mistrust their army and would need a lot of proof to not believe anything the official spokesperson of the army puts out. That's because our army doesn't have a history of lying to us and has no ulterior motives or lust for power.","[R] Megathread III: India-Pakistan Border Skirmish","Please provide legit sources for all updates and information, **no unverified twitter handles/websites**.
