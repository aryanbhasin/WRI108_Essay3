Hub Rank,from,to,weight,title
1,102,273,1,I laughed so much at his cameo. His hand on hip Im watching you pose as Scott trudges off with the wagon of his belongings was so expressive.
1,102,32,1,We also dont know when Far From Home is set. Perhaps it takes place after Homecoming but before the events of the snap?
1,102,50,1,I laughed so hard at that moment. And then Nebula and Gamoras exchange afterwards where Gamora is like Really? This is the guy? and Nebula is like It was between him and a tree.
1,102,258,1,"Tbh I agree. Both are enhanced human beings - Steve by the American scientists and Bucky by the Russian scientists - while Sam is just a normal human being, unfortunately."
1,102,62,1,Im fairly certain that Loki is dead (since he was killed by Thanos before the snap and at the beginning of Infinity War).
1,102,87,1,"Fun fact, the guy in the support group was Joe Russo, one of the directors. I was cracking up so hard during his cameo, but I dont think anyone sitting near me recognized who he was because no one else reacted."
1,102,97,1,Same! That shot where he was running past Nat and off the cliff reminded me so much of his character from Tag also haha
1,102,274,1,"Yes, I felt the same about the first few minutes. The pacing and transitions between the scenes felt jerky."
1,102,275,1,"Howard actually said the opposite. He said that he hopes he has a daughter, so the child is less like himself, and Tony asks why that would be so bad, and Howard replies because he never put the greater good ahead of his own selfish interests. So perhaps Tony was hoping to be the man his father wasnt."
1,102,222,1,Six seasons and a movie!
1,102,235,1,Ive mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still that Ive become invisible to the eye. ===
2,205,253,1,"She has a big hero moment near the end, doesn't ruin the fight against thanos by being OP, and gets a damn dope haircut that makes her more in line with the comics."
2,205,40,1,Yeah that didn't do much for Tony
2,205,74,1,"Some people argue that's either Tony making his first armor or, my theory, the beginnings of Ironheart"
2,205,97,1,"Like, say, a movie :/"
2,205,131,1,Yeah it'll be a tough sell
2,205,151,1,Ughhhhh
2,205,197,1,Yeah but Sam can't throw that shield so hard it'll snap you in half.
2,205,209,1,"But if that was true, why the whole ""back to the future is bullshit"" and the Elder One's ""this is time as you know it""? It's so inconsistent."
2,205,282,1,Hail fucking hydra
3,131,97,1,So much more. =-
3,131,205,2,"She's getting one tho. They say it'll be a prequel about her living in the US 15 years after the Sovjet Union collapsed.  Which is something but I agreed she deserved this movie far before and it feels kind of weird that we're getting it now she's dead.Yeah it's sad they were too scared to do it like 5 or 6 years ago."
4,86,245,1,Everyone in the Cinema went crazy over this!
4,86,97,1,Yeah that was really funny. Cant go bad with Thor and Hulk
4,86,270,1,Thors face when Cap wielded mjolnir was priceless. Hes like a big brother proud and cheering for him
4,86,161,1,"I know that was a punch in the gut for me. But I do get it, he had to die do make the whole thing full circle.But I wish they killed Cap instead. I mean no offense but Chris Evans was very vocal about being hesitant with joining a long franchise film. Its just RDJ is more involve with MCU than him"
4,86,219,1,"I wish they would have mourned Natasha at the same time. I mean everyone was there, can you give a girl a proper goodbye she deserves"
5,91,253,1,She saves Tony and Nebula.  But is gone for most until the big fight.  Her entrances are awesome.
5,91,97,1,That was such a rollercoaster scene with the soul stone.  Really thought it'd be Clint who'd go.
5,91,270,1,Same here with my showing.  Everyone cheered when we saw whose hands mjolnir was flying into.
5,91,164,1,I'm a girl and it was nice but def felt forced.  Gratuituous setup since CM didn't really need the help.
6,206,3,1,"2012 Cap thinks he's fighting Loki. You even see Loki shapeshift into Cap in order to mock him, right before Thor muzzles him."
6,206,250,1,It felt awkward to see Cap in the same shot as Thor and Tony when they see first see Thanos waiting in the rubble; thinking there's no way he could do anything nearly as cool as the other two. Very glad I was wrong
6,206,241,1,"Regarding the hug with Peter it was pretty funny how Piper pulled him off of Tony like ""ok kiddo time for me to be with my husband"""
6,206,205,1,"It would make sense that the audio be from the building of Mark 1, especially considering [Tony mentions the cave](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/quotes?item=qt4442316) in his message to Pepper while shipwrecked.If true the fact the post-credit sound has no video brings out its symbolism. It calls back to a moment when Tony was toiling away, still a few buckets of sweat and elbow grease away from becoming the first Avenger. It is a sound of hope, bearing a deep truth: even when things seem impossible, find the courage in yourself to persevere and you can become extraordinary. Part of the journey is the end, but you have to start somewhere.*message to Piper lol"
7,170,102,1,"Yes! I wanted to share with someone that there were three people involved with the show Community in the movie.I don't know why, but for some reason, that is super cool to me."
7,170,205,1,"I was thinking why she wasn't utilised more in the final battle. But after reading your comment, I guess it would have been like Superman in Justice League.Loved that scene when Thanos headbutts Marvel and she doesn't even flinch."
7,170,222,1,"I made a comment elsewhere, but Danny Pudi cameos in Winter Soldier and Jim Rash cameos in Civil War.Both movies directed by the Russo brothers."
8,124,97,1,Whatever it takes. She was the hero who gave their lives so that others can live. The ultimate sacrifice. A fine end.
8,124,102,1,"1) yeah, but didn't bother me tbh  2) agree. It got to a point that people laughed every time Thor was on screen. After he gets back to himself, with the braided beard, he becomes a battle-hardened warrior. But that was kind of missed by many because of how much of a comic relief he was. They leaned on that too hard  3) I prefer Hawkeye alive. His vigilante ways can be atoned after he reunites with his family - that's the motivation. And it's nice to see a big character die, makes it more 'real' and weighty. It wouldn't have felt the same if it were Hawkeye who died. Would've felt like a cop out  4) I believe that she was too busy to notice. Directors are incredibly busy and absorbed in their work, I can understand that she was too focussed on the problem she was solving to notice his glare  5) no. That was a heavy scene, and too much humor would've ruined it."
8,124,270,1,Applause at that part as well in my viewing. Such a satisfying scene!
9,11,244,1,Oof
9,11,245,1,I knew it! Flashback to age of ultron when Cap made the hammer budge
9,11,95,1,Probably why he is so worthy. Wouldnt steal another mans weapon unless it was absolutely necessary
9,11,205,1,"Yeah this is why I was hoping not to go down the time travel rabbit hole, but whatever. I saw Thanos die and my friends all come back (except you Nat and Tony, rip). It was still an entertaining journey full of tears and laughter (and confusion)."
10,240,42,1,"Oh god, thank you. I've been formulating theories for the past two hours."
10,240,241,1,"Agreed with pretty much everything, especially fat Thor. I appreciated Cap getting the hammer, although I hated the fact that he could throw lightning with it (I thought it served as a focus for Thor's inner power?). Also, I wondered what he ended up doing with it, leading theory for now is that he brought it back to Asgard.   About the problems:  1. Wholeheartedly agree.2. Thor is probably my favorite hero, but I honestly hated this slow descent from king of Asgard to comic relief. The fact that he's going to be sailing with the Guardians is not a good sign. On the other hand, next Guardians of the Galaxy, if they really throw Adam Warlock in the mix, might be nothing short of epic. 3. I thought the same watching the scene, but in the end it kinda made sense. They don't like to take the easy way out in the movies, I guess it's kind of an unwritten rule we all accept in the end."
10,240,205,1,Or with Cersei Lannister. Maybe she's a fan?
11,139,249,1,'I got this! I got this... ok I havn't got this!' xD
11,139,263,1,"That was one of THE highlights of the movie. Cap actually using his knowledge of the future twice to solve a problem without punching. Who would have guessed.  Also having Cap of all people whisper 'Hail Hydra' was just priceless :-D"
11,139,261,1,"Everybody: 'We could fight and try to prevent Thanos from suceeding with all we have!'  Dr. Strange: 'Nah I'm going to go with the Rat timetravel plan! Here Thanos have my Infinity Stone.' xD"
11,139,205,1,"There were a few funny moments before (Bless Paul Rudd for being in this movie) but the 'Hail Hydra' scene was the first that really had me roaring out with laughter :-DEspecially since they set everything up in a way thinking that we would get another iteration of the famous 'elevator fight scene' between Frank Grillo, his crew and Cap. That was just briliantly done!"
12,74,266,1,You didn't hear that hammer-like sound as if someone was forging something?
12,74,205,1,"Could be yeah, but that did feel like a post-credit moment to me, we weren't left with nothing"
13,209,284,1,"Loki escaping and the events of the army base are in different timelines. Everytime they go back, the timeline splits, leaving their own history unchanged, but inside another. When cap gives back the tesseract in 1970, it will have no effect on 2012 whatsoever. Their actions in 2012 will have effect on that timeline, and loki will have escaped in that timeline. When they jump back in time for the first time, I think they created 3 different splits, the Thanos from the timeline where nebula and rhodes went to came back with them, and that alternate universe will never experience an infinity war. The Thanos of the universe where loki escaped with does still exist though, and he loki couldve brought the stone right back to the mad titan."
13,209,106,1,"Prof Hulk actually says cap jumped back to the future, but that he missed. Most likely, cap went back in time to Carter, and then when the cap from the timeline was about to be found in the ice, he jumped back. Giving him about 70 years with Carter."
13,209,205,1,"For everytime that they go back to a time, a new timeline splits off at the moment they arrive back in time. So you now have one universe where infinity war happened, the survivors take infinity stones from the past(but the past from an alternate universe) and one that hasnt seen a snap, one where the Thanos has suddenly vanished. In the alternate universe everyone on knowhere is alive again.When travelling back in time, the timeline always splits, but if they had removed the infinity stones, they had split, AND fucked up the reality of that universe. They needed to take the stones back to their original timelines for the sake of those timelines, they themselves would be completely unharmed if they kept the stones.This also means that they created a timeline where loki escapes with the tesseract, completely screwing the avengers of that timeline over."
14,4,242,1,Too soon
14,4,205,1,This is a meme worthy
15,108,205,1,"Such a masterful fakeout. I was expecting a full-blown re-enactment of TWS elevator fight, but damned if they didnt bamboozle me."
16,114,205,1,"Family for Tony was a death flag, like Natasha's talking about family and how the avengers made her better in that one scene in cap, and like how cap did the hammer thing."
17,151,205,1,The got Hulk to dab.
18,167,205,1,She throws a fucking spaceship at everyone
19,203,205,1,"There's only one timeline for them, in the sense that they can't change their past. But since they can visit other timelines (parallel universes, as explained by The Ancient One), that's the reason why they had to return stuff and not mess up the timeline they were visiting.The timeline/reality where Nebula gets captured and Thanos (of that reality) dies? Well, guess that universe doesn't have Thanos anymore. But changing that timeline's past doesn't affect the OG-timeline."
20,54,97,2,"He looked so lost going ""uh, yeah I can throw this motorcycle I guess. Oh, uh, \*roars\*""I was really sad for her during the debriefing/pb&amp;j scene. It was shown just after Caps support meeting where he was helping people to keep going and maybe move on. But Natasha didnt want to, because the job was all she ever had. And if there was even the slightest chance she can undo it, shes immediately on it without hesitation.During Caps speech and theyre gonna go jump back in time, she was so giddy. The bit where she told Steve see you later was just...damn, thats goodbye."
20,54,98,1,Same. I cringed because it was forced and I know there would be bitching. But I also felt thankful they added it. Besides in the future films thered be more of that girl power. Might as well make those bitching get used to it.
21,25,97,1,That scene was horrible. Two best friends fighting to get to be the one to commit suicide
22,44,97,1,"She didn't deserve that ending. Out of everyone in the MCU, Natasha Romanov led the most painful life. She had a screwed up past, she could never have a family and she didn't even get to end up with Banner. Stark's death really hit me but they celebrated him too much compared to how they mourned Natasha. Without her sacrificing herself, Tony wouldnt even have a gauntlet to snap. I cant believe they just did her dirty like that."
23,219,97,1,"Thinking about it retrospectively, them mourning for her was kinda brief. I mean sure there's a rush to bring the snapped ones back, but at least a scene at the end where they mourn for her like they did for tony stark."
24,149,3,1,Avengers 1 Cap thinks future Cap is Loki.
24,149,266,1,"I'm not sure what a post credit scene could have been that would both be satisfying and not detract/distract from what came before.I half expected it, and it feels like the right move."
24,149,50,1,"She just disappears at the end as well. No goodbye. Just... gone back to the past, I guess."
24,149,278,1,That gave me mad Star Trek 6 vibes. Loved it.
24,149,264,1,Because they were trying to AVOID messing with the timeline. Which is hilarious because they wreck shit like a bull in a China shop and steal a bunch of critical shit like Mjolnir.
24,149,186,1,"I'm confused how this works as well - did everyone come back the same age, or 5 years older, or...? It seems the fallout from snapping everyone back could be just as disastrous and emotionally scarring as having them disappear."
24,149,206,1,Not at all. Remember she's the Gamora from the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy and she was already ready to betray her father then.
25,34,6,1,"Definitely! Especially with Thor on the team, both strands of the MCU are planet jumping adventures, it's gonna be awesome combing the two! Especially if endgame is anything to go off"
25,34,253,1,"She swoops in and saves the day a couple of times, Captain Marvel style."
25,34,254,1,*dabs*
25,34,116,1,Honestly that the best part of the movie when it happened
25,34,149,1,"Yeah, that would suck. He thinks she's back, but he still loses her"
25,34,151,1,They got Thor to play fortnite
25,34,255,1,Kid from IM3
25,34,256,1,100% my thoughts exactly.
26,187,266,1,"Yeah, also Captain Marvel did only one thing right i.e. getting Tony and Nebula home. That was disappointing after all the hype."
26,187,270,1,Also cap takes it back with him in the end
27,119,253,1,"Ill disclose everything I can recall from the final battle.Probably her most significant role: -She stops Thanos mid-snap. My heart nearly stopped.Others include:-Thanos headbutting her. She didnt move an inch.-She basically made herself a human meteor and broke Thanos ship into two by going through it."
27,119,164,1,"It may have been too girl power for some, but I (and everyone else in the cinema) absolutely loved it! Everyone went wild. The only thing that saddened me was the absence of Natasha, especially since she was part of the original girl power scene.Its true CM most likely didnt even need the help, but IMO it definitely trumped the girl power scene in IW. It had Valkyrie on her pegasus!"
28,220,250,1,"I was reaaaaaally hoping for an ""I can do this all day"" from Cap at that point though :("
28,220,241,1,I wouldn't be surprised if Fat Thor was Hemsworth's idea - like he turned up for filming after loafing around in Australia with his family and getting a bit of a dad bod going on and the Directors are a bit mad and then he's like... here's an idea - Thor let himself go and is now a fat neckbeard...
29,143,266,1,"I think the lack of one is important. It signifies the ending of this chapter, a story that has been building up ever since the very first Iron Man was released.We're talking 21 films in the making, all to get to this point. To have a post-credits scene would sort of ruin the whole point. That this is the end.It's not that the Avengers can't have more films either, it's that they'll be set in another chapter. It's not like the comics just ended once the Infinity story was won."
29,143,245,1,"The whole fucking ping-pong shield/hammer scene was a definite highlight for me.I'm a huge fan of slamming some fucking lightning down on a motherfucker, I'm also a huge fan of then slamming a shield into that same motherfucker's face."
30,37,257,1,I feel you man. Who will replace Ironman? I want him and Dr strange to argue with each other more. Two big egos.
30,37,258,1,"I know, it's like grieving."
30,37,252,1,"That's why if the next big great was galatus, how will they defeat him without Tony. It was the most noble sacrifice. I felt like it should have been groot who did the gloves ending as racoon can just replant him alive again."
30,37,161,1,"I have to say watching Tony die really reminded me of how my cat died. Although my cat was kidney failure but at the end, the way Tony was like my cat."
31,156,270,1,So it turns out that Cap just didn't want to flaunt the fact that he was worthy in Ultron.
32,69,81,1,Well present Nebula is without a past Nebula and apparently that isn't a problem.
32,69,265,1,"Dr. Strange: ""If I tell you about the rat that will save the universe, it will never happen."""
32,69,222,1,"No, it's not."
33,118,40,1,"He wasn't really saying much during his final seconds (sort of just gasping for air). I would say that the line ""I am Iron-man"" were his final words"
33,118,206,1,"I thought that was a funny part as well, literally yanked away from tony."
33,118,276,1,"Pretty sad, he just wanted Tony to be happy with him."
34,175,102,1,I didn't know I need this but please can someone arrange Troy and Abed to meet each other in MCU?
34,175,248,1,Haven't heard that many assembles murmured in my whole life and most of them were not even timed right. That kinda dragged me out of the movie and almost ruined one of the most impressive scenes in the whole movie for me =
34,175,231,1,Yup I still can't understand how can Cap showed up in our timeline again if they specifically clarified changing things in the past won't change what has already happened. Theoretically our Cap should be gone forever because he's living in a different branch of reality now. Unless that he pinpointed when and where then dimension jumped here.
35,235,102,1,(4) Steve learn the skill from Drax
35,235,220,1,me too ... but past Capt already said that.
36,125,102,1,"the entire scene with tony and howard i was expecting tony to go oh by the way, anthony is a good name. sad that didnt happen"
37,126,102,1,"I don't like the treatment Star Lord is getting, to be honest. He's more than just a laughing stock. I would be ok with it if there were moments of respect there as well, but them respecting his leadership is very underplayed and making fun of him is overplayed, at least in my opinion"
38,214,102,1,But remember that he stole the terseract so 2012 Loki might be alive
39,40,91,1,Hes got family based plot armor.
39,40,241,1,"What was Tony's last words. Had a baby crying me during that part, like just screaming its lungs out. Must have been about 6mo."
40,38,245,1,Can you explain to me very detailed what makes you love cap so much? i seem to not understand why ppl praise him like a god.
41,99,245,1,Cap became worthy when he chose not to speak with carter even though they are face to face.
42,194,50,1,All the Fortnite developers were snapped. The car designers were bored.
43,3,241,1,How DOES the Cap vs Cap fight happen?  What is the rationale?
44,111,86,1,"Tony, Natasha and vision. Get all 3 done in one go."
44,111,161,1,When she runs the med check on him and it just says critical so she accepts what's happening and just tries to comfort him in his final few seconds :(.
44,111,184,1,Or take the universe down to 1 atom and then rebuild.
45,27,250,1,"I was literally close to crying when I saw Shuri, Okoye, and T'Challa come out of the portal Dr. Strange opened. And then all of them at once. Thanos has an army, and so do they. I remember rubbing my chest to contain my emotions  a rush of overwhelming joy and awe. First time for me to feel something like that. We're lucky to have witnessed one of the greatest movie franchises of the entire entertainment industry."
46,51,250,1,Who was the Teenager boy in the scene ? Was it the boy in Iron man 3 ?
47,85,250,1,It was too short.
48,105,250,1,That scene gave me goosebumps but when tony was against the wall and everyone knew that was his end it was absolutely heart wrenching I cried from then till caps dance with Peggy
49,150,250,1,"I keep coming back to that moment when all the portals opened and I agree. It was more than I wanted, it was just sheer perfection. Let all the tears flow.Avengers... assemble."
50,165,250,1,"I'm just amazed at how gracefully they could introduce time travel in to the MCU. It could have gone terribly wrong, and just introduced a lot of plotholes, but im my opinion, they totally nailed the time travel."
51,188,250,1,*vision and quicksilver crying in the corner*
52,197,258,1,"sam is such a more appropriate character to take up cap's role than bucky in the mcu honestly!!! i mean, emotionally, bucky went through all that brainwashing and torture, steve probably doesn't want him to hold such burden and pain anymore... plus, mcu-aside, sam in the comics is actually quite a mirror to what the world needs captain america to be: he cares about people. all of them: he cares about women, he works hard to make a community (especially his neighborhood) free of violence and fear, he stands for lgbt rights like he does for immigrant people. and i guess bucky already has the new role as white wolf marvel probably wants to give sam a new role!"
53,134,32,1,Different timeline my dudes. Loki is still dead in our timeline
54,152,32,1,It is also possible that everyone in their class died of the snap.
55,234,32,1,Different timelines (alt universes). They are essentially going to alt timelines to borrow their stones and hammer for a bit then returning them. I think.
56,144,151,1,Say greeeeen.
57,166,262,1,"That and the dab moment with hulk were definitely cringe, although the dab moment I think was better because it at least owned the cringe"
57,166,164,1,"It was kinda weird to me. Like I'm all for those girl power moments, but the fact that every single major female MCU character came together in the middle of a chaotic battle at that exact moment makes it feel kinda forced. Like what innate spidette sense told them to do that? The battle against Proxima in Infinity War was done better imo"
58,138,273,1,and Yvette too!!! community represent!!
59,193,62,1,"But there actually was a post credit scene&amp;#x200B;If you listened closely you should have heard someone smithing some iron..."
60,8,164,1,"To me, it was more of a comic book fight scene than a realistic moment in a battle. It was symbolic and so badass. It could be cringy if you perceive it as such, and I get it tbh, just wanted to share my perspective of it. Maybe my only take is that Captain Marvel didn't really need their help to get past those troops lol"
61,98,164,1,"As a long time adult female fan, I cringed at this moment... Not because it existed, but because I know the MCU fans would bitch about it and I wasn't looking forward to reading it.Yes it was unnecessary and forced, but I tell you what, looking into my nine year old daughters eyes at that moment knowing that such an intense line up of strong and powerful female heroes had just set her heart ablaze will trump every single negative comment I see about that one ""unrealistic"" moment in a superhero movie d"
62,224,164,1,"Im a 34 M... that scene was awesome. Hard to describe, I guess it was a FUCK YEAH, YOU GONNA DIE NOW! feeling."
63,184,281,1,"it's not really her past self, it's more an alternate dimension from what i remember"
63,184,204,1,"multiply ressources, you multiply people, multiply the consumption, back to step oneKill half the population, the rest is traumatized and stay his line. If it decide to rebel, snap again anyway"
63,184,282,1,"Thanos here is in full armor, with weapon, motivated to fight to kill, and Thor is in FatThor state"
64,112,259,1,"He kinda disappears in the last battle, I barely recall seeing him when all the fapping of other characters coming in."
64,112,74,1,"Hmm, I recall hearing it and waiting for something to happen ... wasnt sure if I imagined it tho."
65,200,40,1,Family tends to give characters the opposite of armour. Fully expected him to die.
66,97,259,1,"I really enjoyed the ""smash""-Hulk we got when they go back to NY"
66,97,91,1,"Haha same, I was basically cheering at one point when I thought he ""won"" the fight, only to be catched by Natasha again..."
66,97,219,1,Exactly!
67,10,161,1,"Tony Stark deserved a happy ending, instead his daughter is gonna grow up without a father just like he did"
68,190,161,1,Now I would really like to know who will fund the incoming superheroes!
69,198,131,1,"you know who else died for the Soul Stone?  Gamora.  But Gamora is back.  Who said this prequel Black Widow was on the same timeline...?"
69,198,283,1,Kid could really use a vacation lol
70,106,209,1,"Your theory would hold up if it wasn't for the Cap incident in the end, where he travels back in time,   and by your assumption, should thus create a new separate timeline. However, he reappears in the now ""original"" timeline after tonys sacrifice, obviously having altered his own past, and therefore future without swapping timelines. How did the future Cap, fCap, handle existing in a timeline with past Cap, pCap? Did he prevent pCap from being found and took his place, therefore altering the timeline of the discovery of the tesseract? Did he confront pCap with the truth,convince him to lead a different life, and then vanished himself? There is no real way for Cap to meet up with the avengers in the end game timeline as an old man, at least not one that I can find within the frame of their own system.."
71,120,197,1,Won't he have trouble with the police?
72,79,206,1,"I had that feeling when, just after the fight had started, he was throwing punches.  And they're Steve Rogers punches but still just punches!  The hammer thing had been teased and oh man the pay off"
72,79,239,1,"You know, I was trying to figure out when he became worthy between Age of Ultron and that moment, but you're probably right."
73,92,206,1,Thought the same! I really thought that will be Cap's end was really glad that it wasn't
74,109,206,1,"To me it looked more like she was holding him up as he crumbled and collapsed, but I see what you mean"
75,159,206,1,"Her and the bad nebula were already talking about how bad it would be for Thanos to get the stones. I think bad nebula just got thrown by the arrival of good nebula and was scared for her life,  that's why she stayed bad"
76,180,206,1,she was planning to kill thanos from the very first. on the first guardians movie she she wants the orb for herself. she was mad at thanos tha whole time and planning to strike at the right time.
77,201,206,1,"The Gamora who switches sides is taken from the exact time when Quill originally gets the Power Stone.  In the Prime Timeline she betrays Thanos pretty much right after that. He sends her Ronan who sends her to get the Orb, but she goes to get it in order to keep it out of Thanos' and Ronan's hands.  So she had already switched sides really, she was just waiting for the right moment."
78,208,206,1,"I saw it coming, but it was still amazing. Honestly, Caps 1v1 with Thanos was the best 1v1 in that movie, in my opinion."
79,238,206,1,Being a blood-sacrifice can often make people resentful.
80,65,76,1,That was also my sole disappointment! Hulk not getting his redemption against Thanos and Banner/Natasha not happening.
80,65,86,1,"They did kill Cap, in the most heartwarming way possible."
80,65,264,1,"You can't let yourself think about it. The moment I heard ""time heist"", I shut off the part of my brain that tries to make everything make logical sense."
80,65,170,1,"They handled it in a very nuanced way. She shows up, she kicks appropriately titanic ass, and then they have the good sense to let her get punched into an irrelevant rockpile while the heroes we were there to cheer for took care of business. I'll be honest, every second she was on screen I was nervous that they were going to let her steal the movie. I was pleasantly surprised."
81,49,261,1,How many versions out of the 14 million did Dr Strange just watch rats crawl all over the van but miss the button? Haha.
82,61,261,1,"One rat in 14, 000, 000"
83,121,261,1,"Without the rat, there would be no movie"
84,173,95,1,Nice
85,127,42,1,"He is, then my theorie was right. Thanks for confirming"
86,204,42,1,Oh now it makes sense. Wow they managed to care about iron man 3 too? Impressive.
87,23,249,1,Loved this part. Never thought Id see Peter Parker use the instant kill function
88,213,249,1,Woah Woah Woah there buddy! He killed ALIENS so it's all good. But killing actual people is whole 'nother level
89,56,263,1,It's amazing how they were able to tie in that great little nugget.
90,39,98,1,"I'm a grown man and loved that scene. I'm worried about all the hate it's going to get but it doesn't push any agenda, everyone is still fighting, is it so bad to have a badass scene with all these powerful female superheroes that most haven't had their own movie?"
91,154,98,1,"I'm a male and it was such a badass moment that it wasn't cringe at all. It doesn't feel forced to me like other things would and I think if people start critcizing that moment, they're fucking fragile"
92,164,98,1,"Yes! I know there's going to be a lot of hate for that. But as a kid myself still, it felt so cool and surreal."
93,211,98,1,It was such a good scene. I totally know MCU was just trying to pander but god it felt good to see them all have a power shot. MCU can sell this to me as much as they want and I will buy it if it means more women being powerful.
94,19,149,1,"I agree. I feel like a post credit scene would just detract from the weight of the ending. It was about stopping Thanos, undoing the Snap and they did it at the sacrifice of others. The ending was well, the end."
95,47,149,1,"I feel she's dessimated as well, since all those who came along with Thanos were snapped!"
96,87,149,1,"Now that youve mentioned it.Some people already moved on. Some people, like the guy in the support group with Cap, started seeing other people. Are they supposed to just end it all and get back with their old loved ones?"
97,110,149,1,"I think there might be something in Guardians 3. When you see him in the ship at the end, he's searching for her on the computer. And depending on what Tony's 'wish' was, she may not have gone with the rest of Thanos' army. If he thought of snapping all who side with Thanos', then she would have been safe."
98,142,149,1,"What I'm thinking is a few of the baddies who were in prison previously got out/were respawned in a broken prison, bringing back old enemies onto the table for the next phase"
99,146,149,1,That's justified coz cap jumped back and put the pieces back to where they were. .
100,35,186,1,"I was wondering about this too bc Ant Man's daughter is 5 years older &amp;#x200B;Would have loved to see Pena make a cameo!"
101,67,186,1,"I re-watched Winter Soldier, and they never did show Peggy Carter's ""husband"", and their dialogue was very weird.&amp;#x200B;So, yeah. It's plausible that 2 captain Americas existed at the same time."
102,202,186,1,Yeah you right damn
103,229,186,1,"Im really curious about this too. The way it was done it seems like half the universe will now be 5 years younger relative to the other half. Could be some odd ramifications...I do get why they did it that way though - for a minute I thought they might be setting Tony up to choose between his daughter and the mission, and that would have been TOO MUCH TRAUMA for me."
104,231,186,1,Also doesn't having cap grow old get a time paradox?
105,45,6,1,Wasn't it renamed as Asgardians of the Galaxy?
105,45,38,1,"Cap is a straight arrow, a natural leader, tactician, have lost a lot and still willing to give more for the greater good. And most importantly...AMERICA'S ASS!"
105,45,225,1,I'd rather it be Thor: The Melted Ice Cream
106,199,6,1,Perfectly balanced
106,199,226,1,He is still alive tho just an old man cap
107,189,278,1,"I think it's clear that the gen 1 avengers are signing off for the last time here, before the torch gets handed on to spiderman 2 and beyond."
108,210,116,1,"Called me a dickhead!Thor: disconnect now or I'll kill your family"
109,95,86,1,"almost everybody at the cinema clapped in appropriate times. there was a guy pissed off at everyone cheering, so people told him he could get out if he's pissed. we came to cheer."
109,95,168,1,Nice.
109,95,239,1,"my thoughts exactly. but when the hour came, he used it like a badass."
110,226,86,1,Well they kind of killed cap. He lived his life in the past and gave his mantle and shield to sam (I really liked that reference to the comics!).
110,226,118,1,"I just realized the reference to winter soldier where cap outruns Sam while jogging around the lincoln memorial pool. That is genius!Edit: Found the link with the bonus of Cap's catching up book. https://youtu.be/t2E1mLUrBdY"
111,18,247,1,"Cassie was like what, 7-8 at the most in Antman &amp; the Wasp. That's a big 13 year old."
111,18,86,1,And the part where Thor and Cap swap Stormbreaker and Mjolnir!
112,12,86,1,"Had the same experience, SO awesome and im glad I was there!!"
113,123,86,1,"I mean, they did kill Cap, basically. But Ironman's death was inevitable, because he was the main character, and with his death the movie got deeper meaning."
114,153,86,1,"And he shouts I knew it!I liked that bit."
115,216,86,1,"Cap dying wouldve been a pretty sad end for him though bc literally from the start of CATFA he did not catch a single break (bullied kid&gt;serum&gt;war&gt;ice&gt;etc etc) so it makes sense that his story arc ends with some kind of chill.Dont get me wrong tonys my fave and im devastated but as soon as his daughter came up on screen i knew tony was a goner bc he supposedly got his wholesome happy ending"
116,78,257,1,There is avengers X in phase 4
116,78,267,1,"I have mixed ideas about this, when I watched the movie I thought he told Tony to take out one stone so that the snap wouldn't work. Afterwards I thought that he just reminded Tony that they could win in 1 scenario."
117,217,257,1,"That boy at the back of the funeral before captain Marvel was the kid from iron man 3, who is going to be the new iron man."
118,33,252,1,You can rest now Tony
119,178,252,1,That's why Dr strange had to make sure he lived
120,6,34,1,Which makes you wanna watch GotG 3 even more.
120,6,243,1,"Well... for a while it was. After that, I preferred to see good old Bufflord of Thunder"
120,6,118,1,We only have half-- the original three. Thanos won after all.
120,6,220,1,"""I know, I know..."""
121,160,81,1,"How did Cap get to Asgard? Or the other places he was supposed to be returning stones to? Could the Pym suit do that alone? I suppose he used the gauntlet to do a few things (should be okay as long as he doesn't do something snap-sized). Did he go to Vormir and talk to Red? Coz I really want to see how that went. Couldn't he have asked for the deposit back on the Soul stone?EDIT: Also, Cap took the stones back, which eventually get destroyed by Thanos. No stones = bad for the universe. Cap had to head to where Thanos destroyed the stones and use the heisted stones to reassemble them before he returns them for everything not to be screwed."
121,160,172,1,"I'm still curious about what The Ancient One meant when she questions if She had made mistakes when Hulk tells her that Strange simply handed over the stone to save Tony after using it to look for a solution.It was fairly ambiguous, was she meaning that she made a mistake by appointing Strange? Probably not. Perhaps she meant that she'd made the mistake in the other 16mil timelines by not just handing it to Hulk? That kind of seems too blunt though. Now I'm wondering if she meant that she made the mistake of not trusting/supporting Tony and the Avengers sooner, as in context, New York was being attacked by Thanos in 2012 and the sanctum guardians were clearly only interested in defense and concealment.I still actually have no idea..."
122,145,91,1,Both falling would have been such a fail.
123,24,81,1,"Yeah, I think thats a separate timeline. The conversation between Hulk and the Ancient One explained how when the stones would be brought back to their right timelines, those that would split off would cease to exist. Plus they go further back in time, so that timeline would have rewritten that disastrous moment."
124,63,81,1,so how exactly did rocket get the reality stone out of natalie portman and how is cap gonna insert it back to her?
125,236,81,1,Damn so the hammer still got destroyed in the end? I loved the mjolnir and storm breaker combo
126,20,248,1,we waited since Avengers 1 for this moment
127,94,248,1,"I don't know, I kinda wanted him to yell it, triumphantly, you know. Not whisper it, that felt kinda weak. But it is just a minor complaint."
128,141,248,1,"I didnt cry for Black Widows and Tonys death, but when cap summoned Mjolnir and called Avengers Assemble, our theatre went nuts and my eyes were wet!!"
129,196,248,1,Goosebumps 20/10.
130,171,199,1,Like this shouldn't be
130,171,276,1,"Hey guys i'm alive!&amp;#x200B;10 minutes later:&amp;#x200B;Oh fucc he ded"
131,41,259,1,"yeah, I wanted some full blown Hulk action :("
132,183,265,1,All hail Rat-Man!!!
133,228,220,1,Made me think of WarThor after the transformation and braided beard.
134,186,231,1,I think since it was future cap and he went to a time where the other cap was in the ice I didnt have any real impact on the timeline.
135,60,55,1,"I would say that the motivation to do things were different for Tony.We see in Thor 1, that you have to put the interest of others before your own, in order to become worthy. Thor wanted to save the town, Jane and the others and became worthy again. While when he was trying to lift the hammer in the beginning, he couldn't.During Endgame, Tony established that he was only going to participate in the heist, because bringing people back was nice, BUT his priority is to keep what he already has, his family. This means that until the moment when he gets the stones from Thanos and snaps, he was thinking about his family. He even goes out with ""I am Ironman"". A remark about himself and his legacy.Captain America was after the snap trying to help the rest of the survivors. He spoke about moving on, because what's the point if half of the population survives but just dives into depression. The Captain probably didn't even talk to Peggy in 1970 when he had a chance, because it would have endangered the mission. In Civil War, Steve reaches out to Tony in the end, telling him that Cpt America will help, when help is needed. He also wouldn't trade lives when the solution presented itself in Infinity War. Also when Steve fought Thanos with Mjolnir, he probably wanted to keep his promise to Tony, that he and his family would survive. I believe that, in the end, when Steve chose to stay in the past to be with Peggy, he lost his worthiness, because he chose his own interest over the interest of others."
135,60,119,1,"The way Thanos wrestled with her and he ""just"" took out the power stone, punched her and put it back into the glove. What a move."
135,60,239,1,"I don't think it has anything to do with pride. It's about worthiness. in Age of Ultron, Captain tried to lift it out of ego, because it was kind of a competition. In Endgame, the Captain was desperate to fight Thanos which made him worthy and the Hammer reacted to the need."
136,207,37,1,"Cosmic nullifier. And conversation.Like how Reed did it the first time around.I feel sad we'll never see Reed and Tony talk shop."
136,207,99,1,"Cap was always worthy. Even in his first film.After that scene with Carter though, I just knew he wasn't gonna go back when they had him slide at the end."
136,207,239,1,"I think we all knew that was coming with the AoU tease. But seeing Thor go ""I knew it!"" with such a big broad smile made it complete."
137,107,184,1,"&gt; If it decide to rebel, snap again anywayhe destroyed the stones so he never planned on a 2nd snap"
137,107,198,1,somewhere far from home?
138,14,239,1,I KNEW it!
139,212,121,1,"""Father, I shall become...a rat. And step on these buttons with my teensy pawsies"""
139,212,189,1,"We all saw a cinematic tradition that our grandkids are going to witness.Big times."
139,212,204,1,Thor 2 was much more plot significant than I would have ever thought.
140,122,184,1,Thor Lebowskison?
141,50,262,1,Five years in the future and they still play Fortnite on a PS4 but meanwhile drive new Audis
142,130,262,1,That scene is gonna age so well in 10 years
143,137,262,1,LITERALLY
144,30,204,1,"I think Infinity War explained it perfectly. On Titan Thanos saw first hand what overpopulation leads to. That in turn lead him to kill 50% of the population on planets he conquers. Gamoras planet is a paradise after his ""visit"" and that confirms to him that it's a good plan. It doesn't have to make sense to everyone, only to him. He's misguided and can't see any other solutions, especially not after having confirmed it works on individual planets. It's honestly why I think he's such an interesting villain. He's relatable and you can understand his motives, but he's also a madman."
145,179,204,1,Strange was held up holding back the water after Thanos starting firing on earth from his ship. so was out of commission for much of that final battle.
146,222,170,1,I noticed them being from Community but for some reason I didn't make the connection that it's because the Russos worked on Community. Perhaps this is the Community movie we always wanted?
146,222,217,1,"Wait what, is that a real thing?"
147,162,118,1,Thanos' irritation that this puny planet is putting up all the resistance it can muster (including from the 9 realms and outer space) is hilarious.
148,32,247,1,"I'm pretty sure that to make it simpler, they will say that both Ned and MJ died of the snap too, and thus didn't age. Hopefully they will think about mentioning how half their class is now 5 years older though."
148,32,251,1,"I suppose that it definitely means Loki is alive somewhere. I'm very confused as how he could be in the same timeline/universe as the others... but if married!Cap is still in the same universe as the others, then so is escaped!Loki."
149,116,34,1,NOOBMASTER69
150,147,34,1,They got Natasha to play dead.
151,181,34,1,"Korg played fortnite, we saw Thor shit talk noobslayer69 though"
152,26,172,1,"I like it. Its almost like Strange saw the future and was just like, theres no point in fighting and wasting time, heres the time stone and well see you soon for when we win."
153,169,119,1,"&gt; -She stops Thanos mid-snap. My heart nearly stopped.Except you could remove that scene and nothing would change, the fight even still flows. So I wouldn't really class that as important. It's just there to give Marvel a scene."
153,169,129,1,"Except Marvel specifically got a movie [An origin story at that; which Marvel said they wanted to move away from...] between the two films to build her up.Difference between giving dues to established characters and shoehorning one in.Like; Scarlet Witch had an arc; it was revenge for Vision. Strange was there to motivate Stark. Parker for Feels with Stark... most of the characters were basically continueing the fight from Infinity War, fighting on pretty much exactly from where they left off.What is Marvel there for? She has no connections with anyone there. She doesn't contribute to the plot in any way. She just feels like filler. I mean she dosen't even interact with Fury at Stark's funeral or anything. Her purpose in the film is basically to say 'There's places other than Earth you know' as if the Guardians aren't evidence of that; or the various scenes in Infinity War."
154,22,198,1,Or some villain to take his mind of it
155,36,121,1,Theory of the day: the rat is Loki. :p
156,233,189,1,"Except Thor and Hulk. Pretty sure Thor is going to be in GotG 3, while Hulk is going to make cameos here and there"
157,117,11,1,You could say he didn't want to steal his thunder.
158,9,147,1,Too soon man... too soon
159,0,80,1,"Honestly, I read it in the credits but cant remember and now its really bothering me!"
160,1,59,1,I Love Tony Stark 4000
161,2,84,1,Not really a reason why they had to write him that way. They had that talk about Gamma radiation that he can absorb it..yada yada. They could have made him heal the damage or absorb the radiation an go full smash Hulk again.
162,5,156,1,"I think cap was worthy back then but mjolnir was ""sensing"" the avengers were making a game of it so he did not yield to cap when he tried to lift it. But in real battle though, he made himself available to cap. Just my two cents."
163,7,190,1,pepper got all the $$$
164,13,246,1,&gt;I am steve rogers
165,15,113,1,"But thats not when they took the stone, they shouldhave returned it to the base."
166,16,108,1,It was one of the intense moment in the movie. It felt like watching a mission impossible movie where the planes goes completely south and they start improvising.
167,17,65,1,Maybe Banner Natasha happenned in the 5 years. Hulk maybe smashed
168,21,212,1,I was stunned to see Natalie Portman back. I thought she severed ties with the MCU long ago.
169,28,165,1,"im sure that some plot holes will arise eventually, however none were outstanding"
170,29,212,1,Right?! I never thought that would be a thing
171,31,179,1,Theres like 50 wizards there at least one of them must know how to use sling portals
172,42,127,1,"He's the little boy from Iron Man 3, Harley Keener."
173,43,260,1,As someone said. The battle in ready player one but you actually care about the characters.
174,46,166,1,"For me it wasn't a dab, it was a Hulk Hogan pose!"
175,48,177,1,She sacrificed herself to save the only family she's known :(
176,52,107,1,Europe would be nice.
177,53,160,1,"The quantum realm allows for travel in space also. That's how Tony and Steve traveled to that base from NYC. The way I see the time stuff is that those are alternate timelines that they took the stones from, or else we kind of got ourselves a grandfather paradox thing going."
178,55,60,1,"Wondering why Tony wasn't deemed worthy. I believe there's quite a consensus that at the end he was the most worthy of them all, surpassing the destiny his dad left him of not seeing the greater good beyond his personal benefit etc."
179,57,130,1,"It's not supposed to age well. This is our culture, the next generation are welcome to laugh at our stupidity, as we do to our parents."
180,58,169,1,She did save Stark and Nebula
181,59,223,2,"Some brats were making noise at that scene so I bellowed BE QUIET and now my throat hurts like fuckI've watched it twice so far, the first time everyone behaved because there were NO. DAMNED. KIDS. The second time I went slightly berserk because those fuckers were still making noise during Tony's posthumous hologram message."
182,62,127,1,"Huh I thought it might have been Loki in disguise, this makes way much more sense to me. Thanks"
183,64,166,1,Everyone in our cinema lost at the dab lmao

186,70,60,1,"I don't thinks a case of him not being worthy in the end he, had to restore Mjolnir to the timeline so Hella could destroy it in Ragnarok"
187,71,46,1,Didn't he say 'Dab' while dabbing? Or was that someone in my theatre
188,72,75,1,"Yep that seemed super strange. Only explanation i can think of, is that they turned to dust as well at the end of infinity war."
189,73,160,1,"Her mistake was not realizing (however indirectly) that their reality is a bigger picture reality and the impact of his request had already been accounted for by Strange, the best of them. It was one of my favorite parts and I had a lot lot lot of favorite parts."
190,75,72,1,"Unlucky bunch, no wonder their school gives them a trip."
191,76,65,1,"Yeah, absolutely agree. They showed how incredibly powerful she is without her stealing any spotlight. Loved the movie. But I was super bummed they didn't let Hulk shine in battle. BannerHulk is great. Kind of like Korg. But after IW, Hulk deserved a HULKSMASH moment."
192,77,158,1,a for effort but who tf would want to have movie spoiled like this
193,80,0,1,"i think i found it, its called Its Been A Long, Long Time by Harry James"
194,81,113,1,I dont think so. They returned the stones to protect the timeline from greater danger like the ancient one said. But they didnt nothing to rectify the blunders that led to Loki being able to teleport away.
194,81,268,1,I assumed Cap dropped Mjolinir off at the original time in Asgard that they took Hammerand the Ether. Otherwise Past Thor would be without a Hammer
195,82,269,1,"Gamora from the different reality simply lost her purpose, now that Thanos and the whole army has been dusted. After all her only purpose was to kill Thanos regardless of which reality it is. So I assume she just wandered off somewhere, which explains the 'Searching' on the screen when Quill's on the plane, suggesting his next personal quest is to find Gamora.Also, note that it is Gamora from the different reality. The OG Gamora is dead as others mentioned."
195,82,71,1,Nah I definitely heard 'Hulk Dab'

199,89,110,1,Asgardians of the Galaxy!  Been calling that one since the trailers for Infinity War!!!  So excited!!
200,90,28,1,"The time travel rules stated by banner that they would be going into alternate timelines/realities. Everything fits to these rules perfectly except Old Cap being at the end. That doesn't make sense as he never came back through the machine, he carried on in that timeline with Carter. Which should be allowed to happen. Only big plot hole."
200,90,135,1,"Actually that works fine based on the rules set out by Banner. That thanos was from an alternate timeline. So therefore by killing that thanos he never gets the stones in that specific timeline not the main timeline of the MCU.  This is why the old cap bit doesn't work because the rules show that time travel doesn't affect time in a linear way. The thanos from this timeline got the stones, infinity war happened and then was killed at the start of this film. Same reason Nebula didn't vanish when she killed past Nebula, because it's a version of her from an alternate timeline/reality. If they set rules up for how time travel works they should stick to it and all the bits fit except old cap."
201,93,56,1,Absolutely one of my favourite scenes.
201,93,108,1,"My favourite scene by far just because it was a great shoutout to the comic book moment and the Winter Soldier Elevator scene. I admit that while I do not spoil the movie to people who have not seen it, I do say ""Hail Hydra"" to them :D"
202,96,272,1,And what about the soulstone? How exactly did he return it when a trade has already been struck?
203,100,8,1,"Agree with this - I loved seeing all the women together, and fully realising just how amazing they all are. Didn't feel cringey at all  but I definitely thought ""some dudebros are going to whinge about this"".  Would love to see that moment on a poster."
204,101,89,1,do you think thor is in GOTG3? I hope so!
205,103,240,1,"*""Whoever holds this hammer, be they worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""*Explains why Cap could summon lightning."
206,104,160,1,Youre over thinking it. Her mistake really is just not giving it to hulk as soon as he showed up. Shes knows that if strange gave it away it would work.
207,113,15,1,"When Loki has it, that's part of an alternative timeline because events of the past have been altered. Captain would have had to, as you correctly stated, return the stone to the base as that's where it originated from; then also correct the alternative timeline that kicked off when Stark &amp; Lang commenced their attempt at getting the stone. Cap would have had to have stopped them to correct the timeline back to the true timeline."
207,113,237,1,"Loki vanishing is part of the alternative timeline, when the stone was put back, it corrected the timeline."
208,115,130,1,That applies to all product placement though. That Audi e-tron GT insert was so jarring it was basically just an in-movie ad. Same with the Axe body spray 'joke'.
209,128,48,1,God damn i went from eating ice cream happily and then eating ice cream sadly.
210,129,169,1,"You could do the same with most of the battle. If you take out the dam bursting, you don't need Strange, if you don't let Spider-Man get so overwhelmed, you don't need Black Panther helping him out, if you change the timing slightly, you don't need Scarlet Witch, etc.  The whole damn fight scene was a contrivance to make sure every single character would have their moment. It makes no sense to single her out. It was a great scene and a great moment. In Watsonian terms, she really did play an essential part and from an audience perspective, it was pretty damn great to watch."
211,132,45,1,"take your upvote. fine, just take it."
212,133,8,1,"That exactly. All the characters in that scene are amazing in their own right, but it didn't change a single thing for Captain Marvel, she just flies through everything anyway"
213,135,90,2,"Massive time travel plot hole they killed thanos and his army so the whole of infinity war didn't happen the stones were returned but not thanosHmm could cap live out his days on the alternate timeline then after Peggy dies time travel back to his original reality as he was ment to just years later. I guess only problem with that is he should have appeared on the pad?"
214,136,176,1,I can offer a redditor hug?
215,140,277,1,"Hes Harley Keener from iron man 3, the kid who let Tony Stark stayed at his house"
216,148,203,1,"So you're saying that they're not really jumping in time, but jumping between universes. Which makes sense of the double Thanos death. However, how then did Cap grow old within the same universe? Shouldn't he just be in the other one? Without Thanos?"
217,155,69,1,"You didn't understand the time travel, you should think of this movie time travel more of a reality travel, they created a new timeline with a new Gamora, a new Nebula, a new Thanos, etc.The only plothole is how Captain lived in a different timeline until he grew old, then he appeared on the original timeline..."
218,157,127,1,I thought that was a make-a-wish kid
219,158,279,1,Some people are suggesting cap returns all the infinity stones as well as the hammer.
220,161,10,1,True. However she will grow up knowing he saved her and countless others lives. Whereas tony didn't even think his father loved him until he was an adult. And he died knowing he finally did what he always sought to do; protect everyone.
221,163,280,1,"Woah, nice catch - especially since this was meant to be Infinity War Part 2 (making one long 21st film) but became its own thing"
222,168,107,1,Nice.
223,172,178,1,"It's so satisfying to understand why Strange did what he did now. The future he saw in which they won first required them to lose to Thanos, and Stark's role in that future was so critical (from building the time machine to his own snap) that Tony had to survive Infinity War. At the time it looked insane that Strange would trade the Time Stone for Tony's life. Now it all makes perfect sense...talk about a payoff."
224,174,79,1,I think the thing that held him back was knowing what happened to Tony's parents but not telling him.
225,176,68,1,Can I have a robot hug?
225,176,136,1,Ill take what I can get :)
226,177,147,1,Yea out of all people they kill a Russian woman. I went full AC:0 1;O4L because of that
227,182,177,1,"The hardest choices require the strongest wills. Natasha proved herself superior to Thanos with her cliff dive. He would sacrifice anything in service of his goal, but she would sacrifice her own life to save a friend. Her friends saved her from a life of cold, calculating deception and solitude, so it makes sense that they mean so much to her, especially Barton."
228,185,79,1,"People may agree or not that it was a spectacular movie but here something we can ALL agree on : Marvel D=OE=OL=OI=OV=OE=OR=OE=OD=O.EVERYTHING."
229,191,78,1,"The 1 win scenario.Although he did say he wouldn't say he would let him know or it wouldn't happen, I guess he sees the future and he (Strange) did the same gesture then too?Leaving Thanos with the other 5 gems would leave the heroes at a big disadvantage."
229,191,120,1,"""What's that you got there, boy? You got a licence for that Frisbee?""""Requesting backup, we have a black gentleman resisting arrest, &amp; armed with a giant frisbee. "".Sam Wilson: ...."
230,192,229,1,"I assumed they were setting up Iron Man (daughter, has moved on, doesn't want to undo it) vs Hawkeye (family dead, has become a vengeful killing machine, willing to do anything to get his family back)&amp;#x200B;then they didn't do that at all."
231,195,2,1,"Well I think the point there is to set up Tonys death believably. Because its not just about inner strength or bei g worthy, you have to be physically able to take a good punch to wield the gauntlet, and even if you have resistance like Hulk, youre gonna end up hurting real bad."
232,215,72,1,I liked that she didn't have that big of a role of beating thanos.
233,218,5,1,"I think Cap was worthy back in Avengers 2, but when he realized that he was, he chose not to pick up Mjolnir, in order to keep Thor's ego intact. This decision proves again that Cap is worthy, since an unworthy person would have picked up Mjolnir and embarrassed Thor."
234,221,277,1,Kid from iron man 3
235,223,59,3,"Holy fuck at the end when his hologram said that to his daughter my eyes exploded with tears =-=-I cant believe they actually were talking/making noise during THAT scene! What the hell is wrong with people?! My cinema was stone silent. The only noise was sobbing and crying =-=-Thats disgusting, I feel so sorry for you man. Kids are the absolute worst for being pricks in moments like that. Nothing more aggravating than a noisy brat in a heartwrenching scene. If they had ruined that for me Id have been more pissed than old hulk."
235,223,285,1,"Me included. This is to prove Tony Stark had a heart. Im proud to admit that I was crying manly tears. Rip Tony, Im gonna miss your wit, your humour and your part in this wonderful saga."
236,225,45,2,"It's a comic nod and could also be seen as Thor being cocky and trying to take over the Milano. I don't think the next GOTG will actually be called that but we'll see.Such a good line."
237,227,183,1,Hope they do an origin movie for Rat-Man. The one out of 14 million
238,230,137,1,DOZENS
238,230,240,1,"Thor went through a complete and unexpected arc in the last movie. He suffered the entire movie just do he can come back of that sweet revenge. That's some heroics right there, and in that regard the movie did him justice. A comic relief is a nice change of tone.Elaborate explanations can never be elaborate enough to convince unwitting characters to obey when there's such a small window of time. Old cap would cling on to the real cap and insist to have his questions answered, which would be pestering."
239,232,160,1,"Sorry, no exchanges or returns."
240,237,268,1,Isnt there a Loki show coming up? Since he died in Infinity War I'm assuming the show will be about the Loki the teleports away in the past
241,239,11,1,"He probably knew he could lift it, but stopped to not ruin Thor's pride"
