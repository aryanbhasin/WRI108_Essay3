The thanos from this timeline got the stones, infinity war happened and then was killed at the start of this film.

We see in Thor 1, that you have to put the interest of others before your own, in order to become worthy. Thor wanted to save the town, Jane and the others and became worthy again. While when he was trying to lift the hammer in the beginning, he couldn't.

During Endgame, Tony established that he was only going to participate in the heist, because bringing people back was nice, BUT his priority is to keep what he already has, his family. This means that until the moment when he gets the stones from Thanos and snaps, he was thinking about his family. He even goes out with ""I am Ironman"". A remark about himself and his legacy.

Captain America was after the snap trying to help the rest of the survivors. He spoke about moving on, because what's the point if half of the population survives but just dives into depression. 
The Captain probably didn't even talk to Peggy in 1970 when he had a chance, because it would have endangered the mission. 

In Civil War, Steve reaches out to Tony in the end, telling him that Cpt America will help, when help is needed. He also wouldn't trade lives when the solution presented itself in Infinity War. Also when Steve fought Thanos with Mjolnir, he probably wanted to keep his promise to Tony, that he and his family would survive. 

I believe that, in the end, when Steve chose to stay in the past to be with Peggy, he lost his worthiness, because he chose his own interest over the interest of others.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

Perhaps she meant that she'd made the mistake in the other 16mil timelines by not just handing it to Hulk? That kind of seems too blunt though. Now I'm wondering if she meant that she made the mistake of not trusting/supporting Tony and the Avengers sooner, as in context, New York was being attacked by Thanos in 2012 and the sanctum guardians were clearly only interested in defense and concealment.

What is Marvel there for? She has no connections with anyone there. She doesn't contribute to the plot in any way. She just feels like filler. I mean she dosen't even interact with Fury at Stark's funeral or anything.

Their actions in 2012 will have effect on that timeline, and loki will have escaped in that timeline. 

When they jump back in time for the first time, I think they created 3 different splits, the Thanos from the timeline where nebula and rhodes went to came back with them, and that alternate universe will never experience an infinity war.

Okay. This is gonna be a shitton of spoilers (duh)

Warning: HUGE wall of text incoming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So at the start, the heroes that survived (Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Thor, War Machine, Nebula and Rocket) went and killed Thanos (Thor decapitated him) but this didn't resolve anything since Thanos destroyed the infinity stones 2 days prior.

&amp;#x200B;

5-year time jump

&amp;#x200B;

A rat stepped on the controls of the PymMobile (what is it called again?) and returned Antman from the Quantum Realm. Antman goes to Avengers HQ and proposes to use the Quantum Realm to go back in time.

&amp;#x200B;

Captain America, Black Widow and Antman go to see Iron Man about this idea and we find out Tony Stark and Pepper married and had a daughter. As a result, Tony refuses to help them build the time machine. The three of them then go to see Bruce instead to see if he can help, and he is now Professor Hulk (Bruce and Hulk combined living together). They talk (Hulk dabs) and Bruce says he can try.

&amp;#x200B;

They try to make the machine and it works... Kinda but not really. Meanwhile, Tony Stark makes a breakthrough and finds out the time machine plan will work, and he shows up to Avengers HQ in a shiny Audi. Tony agrees to help and says he's gonna need everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

War Machine comes back from Mexico, Nebula and Rocket come back from... Somewhere...

&amp;#x200B;

Rocket and Hulk go to Asgard 2.0 to find Thor only to find him fat as hell, drunk and playing Fortnite. They eventually convince him to come back to Avengers HQ with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Black Widow goes to Japan to find Hawkeye, who is now Ronin (not the accuser) and brings him back as well.

&amp;#x200B;

After they all assemble, they all go back into time to get the infinity stones so they can do their own snap. Rocket and Thor go to Asgard to get the Reality Stone, Nebula and War Machines goes to Morag to get the Power stone, Black Widow and Hawkeye goes to Vormir to get the Soul Stone, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Antman goes to 2012 New York to get the Time Stone, Mind Stone and Space Stone respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

In Asgard, Rocket and Thor are trying to extract the Ether from Jane (Thor's girlfriend. Is this her name?) Whilst Rocket does this, Thor wanders off and accidentally runs into his mother. They chat for a bit and as they are about to leave, Thor summons Mjolnir and leaves with it, proving that he is still worthy.

&amp;#x200B;

On Morag, Immediately after Nebula and Warmachine arrive, Nebula's memories sync up with the Memories of 2014 Nebula, and as a result, Thanos finds out everything about the future through present day Nebula. Nebula and Warmachine knock out Peter Quill and steals the power stone, but as they are leaving, War Machine successfully leaves but Nebula is captured by 2014 Nebula. 2014 Nebula takes her place and comes back to the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, on Vormir, Black Widow and Hawkeye climb the mountain in order to find the Soul Stone, where they are greeted by Red Skull, who explains a sacrifice is needed. ""A soul for a soul"". Black Widow and Hawkeye debate over who gets to sacrifice themselves, and both of them want to do it. They fight over who does it and Hawkeye throws himself off the cliff but Black Widow grapples him to the cliff and throws herself off. Hawkeye ends up with the Soul Stone and comes back to Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Back on Earth in 2012, The Hulk is sent to retrieve the Time Stone. He reasons with The Ancient One, saying that he needs the stone. The Ancient One argues that she cannot give the Stone away, otherwise their timeline will be unbalanced due to the missing Stone. After some time, she eventually agrees to give over the Stone, but only if they return it back to the exact time they took it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few blocks away in Avengers Tower, Iron Man and Antman are tasked to retrieve the Space Stone. Antman shrinks down and goes into the arc reactor of 2012 Iron Man, who is holding the briefcase containing the Tesseract as well as holding Loki prisoner. Antman pulls a wire and as a result, Iron Man collapses to the floor. During the chaos, present day Iron Man takes the briefcase and starts to leave but is accidentally thrown across the room by an angry 2012 Hulk. The briefcase breaks opens and the Tesseract lands between Loki's feet. Loki picks up the Tesseract and teleports away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few floors above all this, Captain America gets into the same elevator as the SHIELD agents (Hydra spies in disguise) who are safeguarding the Sceptre, which contains the Mind Stone. Captain America whispers ""Hail Hydra"" to the spy and he hands the Sceptre over to Captain America. As Captain America is leaving however, he runs into 2012 Captain America, who is looking for the missing Loki. They fight each other and present-day Captain America wins by pacifying 2012 Captain America with the Sceptre and comments ""That is America's ass"".

&amp;#x200B;

Iron Man tells Captain America about how they screwed up and lost the Space Stone, and they decide to go back in time one more time, back to when Tony's father, Howard Stark, was working on the Tesseract. Back in 1941, Tony goes down into his father's laboratory and steals the Tesseract, and as he was leaving, runs into his father. He introduces himself as Howard Potts and they talk a bit. Meanwhile, Captain America sneaks into Henry Pym's laboratory to steal some more Pym Particles, which are used to teleport through the Quantum Realm. He accidentally walks into Margaret Carter's office and stares at her before leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

The nine heroes return to the present day (With 2014 Nebula in tow and Black Widow dead), and assembles the Infinity Stones onto a gauntlet which Iron Man made. Hulk volunteers to be the one that snaps, and he does it, injuring himself badly in the process. In the other room, however, Nebula reprograms the Teleporter and teleports Thanos' ship over to Earth. Just as the Avengers celebrate the snap, however, Thanos destroys Avengers HQ with his gunship. Thanos beams down to Earth and orders Nebula to find the Gauntlet and give it to him. Meanwhile, he just sits in the rubble, waiting for the Avengers to show up.

&amp;#x200B;

Hawkeye wakes up with the Gauntlet right next to him and realises that danger that if Thanos gets his hands on it, they're all doomed. He picks it up and starts running away but runs into Nebula. Nebula knocks Hawkeye down to the ground and just as she is about to kill him, present-day Nebula and 2014 Gamora shows up and tries to convince Nebula not to kill him. Present-day Nebula shoots 2014 Nebula(???) and helps Hawkeye up.

&amp;#x200B;

Hulk, War Machine and Rocket are trapped in the basement with water flooding in and calls for help. Antman responds and starts to make his way over to the basement.

&amp;#x200B;

Iron Man, Captain America and Thor are up top and sees Thanos sitting in the rubble. The three of them attacks Thanos. Some time through the battle, Thor throws Mjolnir at Thanos but Thanos picks up Iron Man and uses his body as a shield. This hit pacifies Iron man. Thanos starts fighting with Thor and eventually gains the upper hand, pushing Stormbreaker into Thor's chest. As Thanos is about to go for the final push, he is hit in the head by Mjolnir, which Captain America is seen to be controlling (Hell yeah, Cap's worthy!). The two of them then duke it out, with Captain America fighting Thanos with both Mjolnir and his Shield, but after some time Thanos breaks Captain America's shield and throws him to the ground.

Soon, hundreds of these portals open and everyone that was snapped comes out. We see Spiderman, Falcon, Wanda, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wasp, Bucky and Doctor Strange comes out (Sorry if I forgot someone) along with the armies of Wakanda and the Magicians of all the sanctions. We also see Antman grow huge out of the rubble, saving Rocket, War Machine and the Hulk. Valkyrie also arrives and Captain Marvel comes later.

&amp;#x200B;

An EPIC battle scene happens which words cannot describe, but during the conflict, we see Spiderman reuniting with Iron Man, who hugs Spiderman (Sweetest part of the movie) and Star-Lord, who gets saved by 2014 Gamora. Peter goes in for a hug but gets kneed in the balls since 2014 Gamora has never seen him before in her entire life. She asks Nebula is this is who she falls in love with, and she responds with ""It was either this or a tree"".

&amp;#x200B;

Antman and the Wasp are sent to the Pymmobile (I'm just gonna call it this) to try an start up the portal and they can throw the Gauntlet away, losing it in the Quantum Realm (Is this what happens?). We see Hawkeye starting with the Gauntlet, passing it to Black Panther, Spiderman and lastly Captain Marvel.

&amp;#x200B;

The gauntlet somehow ends up with Thanos, and he puts it on. As he is about to snap, Captain Marvel stops him but he takes the Power Stone off the gauntlet and uses it to punch Captain Marvel out of the way. As he goes in for a second attempt, Iron Man flies in and steals the Infinity Stones off the gauntlet. He attaches the stones to his own armour and snaps his fingers, erasing all of Thanos' army but killing himself in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there is a funeral for Tony Stark and everyone is there (except for Gamora, who ran off and is now missing, including that one kid from Iron Man 3 who saved him (Like why the hell is this kid here???). Thor makes Valkyrie queen of New Asgard and goes off with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Captain America then goes back in time one last time to return all six of the Infinity Stones as well as Mjolnir. However, he doesn't come back through the portal and we see that he decided to ""get a life"" and married Carter and grew old with her. He then passes his shield down to Sam (Falcon) and the movie ends.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

Like she was definitely younger than ten in the last Ant Man movie, and the actress that played her here looked like she was in her early twenties at least.

(2) Like many others, I was disappointed that Thor stayed fat for the entire movie and that the directors/writers leaned into his appearance as a constant source of comedic relief, but my interpretation was that once he summoned lightning and his old outfit with the red cape showed up plus his beard was suddenly braided at the beginning of the battle with Thanos, his appearance was maintained as such to reflect that a more aged, mature version of Thor more in line with the All Father (a role he took on after Odin died in Ragnarok) as opposed to the youthful, hunky Asgardian prince. And so his portly appearance shifted from being a product of beer and cheese whiz to reflecting his mental aging from weathering many tragedies.

(3) Did anyone else REALLY want Clint to die for the soul stone instead of Nat? Like I get that Clint had a family while Nat didnt, so maybe she would be less missed, but I feel like it would have made sense that he sacrificed himself to atone for taking on the vigilante role after the snap. Like it would have been more coherent with his story by offsetting his turn to the dark side during the five years, and it would have been so beautiful and poetic that he sacrificed himself to bring his family back, even if he couldnt be there with them. 

(4) Did anyone else find the scene where Steve is in Peggys office a little too unrealistic, like he was 2 inches away from her on the other side of a window, staring holes into her. Like how would any normal person not notice someone staring so intensely at them, especially when that someone is in her office?

2) agree. It got to a point that people laughed every time Thor was on screen. After he gets back to himself, with the braided beard, he becomes a battle-hardened warrior. But that was kind of missed by many because of how much of a comic relief he was. They leaned on that too hard  
3) I prefer Hawkeye alive. His vigilante ways can be atoned after he reunites with his family - that's the motivation. And it's nice to see a big character die, makes it more 'real' and weighty. It wouldn't have felt the same if it were Hawkeye who died. Would've felt like a cop out  
4) I believe that she was too busy to notice. Directors are incredibly busy and absorbed in their work, I can understand that she was too focussed on the problem she was solving to notice his glare

Something thats been built up since the first movie after credits scene. And going back to his roots of getting beat up in the street and just. Refusing. To. Stay. Down. And he got his dance. 



Also a great send off to Iron Man, ending with his catch phrase (for I think only the second time he says it in the MCU: I wonder how intentionally the writers had to restrict themselves from using it. Would it have been more impactful if he said it every movie or just as is?). Huge growth from him, making a sacrifice I think he only could have made after finding catharsis with his own father. (Its different sacrificing yourselves as a single man than a father, he was willing to lay down on the barbed wire during the first Avengers but kids change things.) 

Im also glad he got to hug Peter and outwardly express himself, again something he struggled with even in the last avengers film. 

Fat Thor got old, I was hoping he would thin out after he first summoned lightning. 

Only three problems with the film;

1) if youre going to go back in time 5 years, why not go back 5 years and 6 months. Train up, do rehearsals, sober Thor up before you send him back in time? 

2) not sure Ill watch the next guardians movie with Thor featured so prominently. I felt like they were finally clicking after the second guardians, and weve already done the whole whos the best pill, whos the real captain schtick. Thought it was a weird character decision for him. Not ruling? Sure. Going with the guardians? Eh...

3) why not own up to being from the future? Captain America vs captain America was pretty fun, but also could have been avoided by like a few sentences. No Im not Loki I was born on this day and time, the love of our life is this girl, heres he photo I have the same compass.

I appreciated Cap getting the hammer, although I hated the fact that he could throw lightning with it (I thought it served as a focus for Thor's inner power?). Also, I wondered what he ended up doing with it, leading theory for now is that he brought it back to Asgard.   
About the problems:  


1. Wholeheartedly agree.
2. Thor is probably my favorite hero, but I honestly hated this slow descent from king of Asgard to comic relief. The fact that he's going to be sailing with the Guardians is not a good sign. On the other hand, next Guardians of the Galaxy, if they really throw Adam Warlock in the mix, might be nothing short of epic. 
3. I thought the same watching the scene, but in the end it kinda made sense. They don't like to take the easy way out in the movies, I guess it's kind of an unwritten rule we all accept in the end.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

Hulkbanner was fantastic to witness and he played those cringey parts well. His encounter with the SupremeBaldy was brilliant.

&amp;#x200B;

LebowskiThor was a major surprise and he still had his beer gut in the final fight scene! Such an aussie.

&amp;#x200B;

SoulYouLaterWidow was a kick in the guts but it made sense since she didn't have a family like GenjiEye

&amp;#x200B;

MyWifiIsOpenNebula was fantastic and surprising to see she never went the path of the comics.

&amp;#x200B;

MCapHammer had me squeal like a bitch! Hail Hydra and the final scene when he proves his worth was fucking epic.

&amp;#x200B;

NoMoreSparkStark was heart breaking yet poetic. It all started with the first Iron Man movie and ended with his snap.

&amp;#x200B;

ICouldOfKilledThanosInInfiniteWarsWitch finally got her arse kicking scene with Thanos. Just a shame that Thanos had an Anti-Witch ship behind him. PS, She is such a great actress.

&amp;#x200B;

OnePunchMarvel was well placed into the movie and her new haircut was banging! Aslo, Thanos when he head butted Carol and she just stood there and you could hear that voice over ""In this moment, he knew he had fucked up"" -10 points for Thanos and that dog power stone trick.

&amp;#x200B;

Spoilerman finally got to use his kill mode! Poor fucked had to see Tony fade to black though and kinda pissed CastIronPotts off since she had less hug time.

&amp;#x200B;

RocketDad was very well balanced and im glad he had more time with Thor to help set him straight.

&amp;#x200B;

When Cap and Tony went back into the past, i said to the wife ""Holy shittttttt, Howard and Margaret"".

I was so overwhelmed with emotions to see this play out that i should of seen this foreshadow the ending more.

They got to see/experience pieces of their past that they either missed out on or had taken away from them (thanks Bucky you cunt, it only took Time Travel for Tony to play actually have a decent conversation with his Dad.)

The final battle when everyone comes back was just utterly insane. 21 films and we get to see nearly everyone in this scene line up with Cap wielding Mjolnir finally uttering those words ""Fuck these cunts""... wait ""Avengers Assemble"". Sorry the Aussie version was changed apparently.

This will honestly need a 2nd watch just to take everything in!","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

Basically:

* They say back to the future is bullshit, you can't create a new timeline by going back, you just create a paradox 
* however, the reason there's only one timeline is because of the reality stones. You remove one, that *does* create an alternate timeline 
* Because of that, they try to keep their interactions in the present minimal, and just being back the stones to the exact moment they were removed, that fixes things 
* except that they totally don't and Thanos' ship gets destroyed around the time of GotG 1. So... Why are the guardians still on earth? If Thanos died around guardians 1, is everyone on knowhere alive again?

The moment I saw Cap on the bench at the end, I knew, and it made my heart so stupidly happy.  
  
  
A couple of things I'm unsure of: how do they recapture Loki in NY before Thor takes him back? Thanos and co came from the past and then disappeared into dust but they need to continue on in their own timeline for everything to happen so did Tony just send them back in time? And only thing they can't repair is Star Lord's dance being interrupted when getting the power stone.  
  
  
Love love loved the scene where we saw everyone come through the portals. During Civil War it was amazing that there were so many characters whose stories we knew, but this was totally next level. Also made me even more aware of how many we lost after Infinity War.

The start of the movie was heartbreaking with Hawkeye losing his family and not understanding what happened to them. 

Thor's story after he kills thanks is a bit shit, but you have to remember that he lost everyone before the snap (which is why he follows his mum around). After the snap he lost his way and is just fat the whole movie which is a shit way to end the infinity saga. Especially with the big three not looking their best for the final fight. It would have made sense to show them at their very best

Iron man's story was good to me, it showed that he would rather die than see any other avengers lay their life down. It's good to see he finally makes the most and tries to move on after the snap. But after he's experienced being a father and seing his father, I feel at least he gets some closure. (During the end fight with the big three, i honestly thought that's was gonna rip him in half during the fight)

Caps story is also good that he finally gets what he wanted instead of what others want. Throughout the captain America movies, you see that he just wants to go back and live his life out with Peggy. I feel most of them deserved a send off but it also feels rushed where as if they took their time with the movie it would have been better. 

The big battle at the end had to be the most epic thing I have seen, would've have been good to get all the avengers in one shot and have the theme music play.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

- Nebula killed her past self but stays alive. Apparently that's possible in the MCU, we agree on that?
- So that means if she had *not* killed herself, both versions of her could have potentially stayed in the future together?
- If that's possible, it means they could also potentially travel further back in time, find a younger Nebula, bring her to the future and there would be 3 Nebula. This process could be repeated ad infinitum and it's possible to have 100 Nebula living together?
- (please give me a second to imagine a orgy with multiple Loki thank you)

Am I correct or what? I'm so very confused.
And mostly I want to know whether I can consider that Loki is still alive and in the same timeline/universe as the others, even though a version of him was killed by Thanos.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

1. How did Valkyrie and the other few Asgardians survive Thanos' first attack on their ship? While I admit that they don't specifically show her death scene, I always felt that it was implied that only Thor survived that explosion and everyone else blew up in space. Unless they had an escape pod or something that we didn't see during the attack, there's no other way for her to just show up now on Earth/New Asgard.

2. Stark's ability to replicate the infinity gauntlet. It took the power of the Nidavillir forge and the dwarves to build an infinity gauntlet. Smart as Stark is, I don't see how his nano tech could replicate the ability to harness the power of the universe. Not to mention that he actually did it again, on the fly, when he grabbed the stones and nano-teched his suit to hold the stones for the final finger snap.

So yeah, just some plot holes I was wondering about. Doesn't change the fact that the movie was great though.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.

\-I really wanted to see the world after the snap, but I thought the movie would take place in a few days following it. When Thanos was beheaded and the 5 years later text popped up, I almost pissed my pants in excitement.

\-I figured time travel would be in the movie, but I'm so glad they decided to bring everyone back to the future, and not undo the whole thing. That way the entirety of Infinity War would have been retrospectively pointless.

\-I was also afraid that they would just bring everyone back and completely ignore that Thanos had an actual goal and this wasn't just pure sadism. So when Thanos told them that he know sees that his plan is impossible in a world which will remember, once again, I almost cried tears of joy. I'm absolutely serious, the LAST THING I expected from this movie was to actually give some thought to this question.

\-I'm really glad Hulk's snap only resurrected the people who died from the actual snap. Loki, Vision, Gamora and Black Widow seem dead as of now, and while they can still be brought back in the future, I'm really happy for the time being. I think this was the right choice, and I'm glad the Russos had the balls for it.

\-Talking about balls, they killed off Tony and game Captain America a fitting closure. F\*CKING YES! I was so scared that they would just give both of them an early retirement, because they would be afraid of the fans' reaction. I'm so glad they played it this way. This completed both Tony's and Cap's arc beautifully.

\-Also, I had worries about the character of Thanos. In Infinity War, he went through this incredible journey, which inherently changed him. You can already see that at the end of Infinity War, and I was really scared that he would throw all that character development out the window, and start fighting the Avengers again. When they found him at his homestead, he died like I wanted him to die. Like an experienced old man, who has seen everything, and who is still absolutely sure he was right. And bringing back a younger, more hot-headed, more passionate and less wise Thanos to fight the Avengers was in my opinion a genius idea. 

Yeah, that's pretty much it. Movie was dope.","Endgame Discussion Megathread [SPOILERS]","Yes we all know you saw Endgame and want to talk about it with everybody else who saw it.
