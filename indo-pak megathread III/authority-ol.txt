Doesnt matter. This is crazy stuff to retweet/reply to. that's it? >#=huh? that isn't a sensitive area otherwise you would never get any pictures. but we do have pictures which means it isn't sensitive/blocked by google. he said we were being targetted. as in they were the goal, that doesn't mean they were hit. it's been said many times that there was a madressa in that area but missed by few kilometres. wasn't promptly closed. 2 days after is when it closed, when pak caught indian pilot and there were news of a possible attack.fyi reuter, independent and washington post have articles out. try reading them. not a single one supports indian narrative. Attack happened on the 25th actually. Flights were stopped on the day of pilot arrest when escalation was happening.FYI some Indian airports were closed the same day too. &gt;"Srinagar, Jammu and Leh airports were among five airports closed on Wednesday for civilian air traffic shortly after an IAF [Indian Air Force] jet crashed in Kashmirs Budgam district," the Press Trust of India, a news agency reported.Really? As a Pakistani, when I read NDTV twitter comments, they are usually getting bashed. I thought maybe they're biased. im being sarcastic. i mean seriously? we are going off what "eye witness" said now? how the fuck do you know there was a ISI agent or ek-pak army killed? amount of delusion is insane to believe that but not give any attention to satellite verification conducted independently. no one can erase that proof, not pakistan nor india. https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/were-indias-airstrikes-in-pakistan-a-strategy-for-public-approval/because pakistan never denied his existence in pakistan or acknowledged him as a terrorist. what exactly is the big deal? we already know pakistan doesn't acknowledge him as one otherwise there would be a legitimate case for india intl to ask why he isn't in jail. not pakistan. and as the minister claims here, it was supposedly conveyed to him that JeM denied involvement. i think indians need to realize that whether you call them terrorist sor not it doesn't matter. it matters if pakistan does and they dont so there is no "blunder" in what the minister has said here. i dont know why indians are so delusional. setting your own goal posts that you know you can achieve even if they make no sense. pakistan never denied jem existence in pakistan so what is the big deal? pakistan has confessed their contact with azhar masood, not jem. learn to differentiate organization with individual&gt;No country will share details of their military operations and that includes US who has scarcely given details about their counter terrorist ops in past and present.no one is asking for military details. this is a bombing, you can easily prove it by satellite images which won't compromise any military details. &gt; If Pakistan so staunchly believes that no terrorists are being raised on it's soil, why are you hell bent on asking for a proof?because u keep crying about it. being a neighbour country, we have to look into your reservations. or you think we should ignore you? that would be better?he didn't say that. jem is banned, not azhar mehmood. how is it very well documented if you have no proof? yes we require proof, we will not do something just because you said so. likewise we don't expect you to do anything just because we said so. its illogical. NDTV is the most trusted and most unbiased of all media houses.Last night he claimed several Indian soldiers have been taken out by Paki Snipers and India in retaliation started shelling with the MBRL. According to 'sources' ofcourse. I chose to stay away from these unverified intelligence handles for my own sanity.Yeah! Modi just pitched the urgent need for the Rafale Jets.It was about calling out the hypocrisy in Pakistan's peace gesture.Mostly because they suspect another escalation from India and it seems PAF utilises civilian airports for its operationsyeah, lets go back in history and quote unrelated 'alleged' events to the present scenarioSame, if you want to remain stuck on the video, instead of looking at the bigger picture that you got your guy aliveI could google several events where you were the bad guys at a certain turn of history and quote here, but what would be the point? The gesture of releasing him was about peace. Not finding and then stuck onto imperfections in those actsWhat I did, all those comments, it wasn't for them, I did it for me, I guess. I have been having identity crisis, and events like these only make it clear where I belong. I thought of myself as someone who could acknowledge good or bad, irrespective of their national background, think critically, but I see hatred winning over every single battle and it's pointless to debate when majority in the world just want one over you to win an argument, rather than going for objectivity.This is true for my own countrymen as well, but seeing myself &amp; few others, as people who could take a saner perspective when shit hits the fan here, I thought may be I could find myself among them, but I was so wrong. I don't suppose this would make sensePakistan is the hypocrite as it made a video of the guy who it saved from mob lynching and was about to hand over, sure. What do you think about the body of Pakistani prisoner who was killed in your prison?Why does the video matter so much when the guy can contradict with that as soon as he is going to cross over? May be some people just need an excuse to hate othersWhat part of not killing the guy you don't understand? If a 'coerced' video of him make Pakistan look ingenuine, then may be it's lost to give peace another chance. May as well go to war, since there will always be people unhappy about the semantics of things being done for peace.What were the jail authorities doing when the inmates were stoning our guy? Guess, he didn't get saved like your pilot who was attacked by our mob.I don't expect an investigation into it regarding why this happened, or who overlooked the safety of him as that would only anger your extremists. Despite being called a terrorist nation, sanity still prevailed here. You can't make everyone happy. If it weren't the video, people may have jumped upon why he wasn't sent via air. Or why wasn't he saved earlier. Or why wasn't he fed pizza. It's useless to make such things an excuse when at the end of the day, what matters most, is we returned your guy alive. With all the extremism my country has, I think it was an achievement on our part. It's not a competition, but i expected better than a body in response.So are mobs, but guess what? Sanity prevailed and the armed officers, of the same army you criticize for the cuts, saved him from lynching. I wonder what Geneva conventions say about not giving a fuck about the enemy fighter jet pilot, who crossed the border in a bid to target the locals there only to find being torn apart by their hands.world is not trashing pakistan. As far as global media is concerned pakistan came out as the good guys just their video released after abhinandan was in india portrayed them in bad light . Thats why they took down the video from all their media handles. no1 has openly taken sides as things havent escalated to that degreeit aint an excuse to hate. It was all great when it was peace gesture to release him. Releasing a doctored and forced video with 50 cuts is what pissed off people here. There was 0 need for it and moreover added no info that was already known. Worst thing u took interview of our commander in uniform but later was returned in a suit ? Do u know see your fault or still wanna talk here with ur nonsensical facts ?there is no coverage of that news anywhere on indian media. Full disclosure we all hate our media thats why rely on twitter. If its true my heart goes out to u. And what does real life offer? Nuclear war between two retarded nations?Just wait for the 2020 Bollywood rendition where he jumps out of his MiG on to a Pakistani F-16 and bitch slaps the Pakistani pilot into oblivion. Then he jumps back into his plane only to be dropped into Pakistani territory but he manages to survive immense torture from the Pakistani army. Afterwards, he slips past them and escapes to India on foot killing three whole battalions with a 9 MM. The movie stars Ajay Devgan as Abhinandan and Boman Irani as the evil Pakistani Foreign Minister.Dont get your panties all twisted, its my Dota 2 and CS:GO gamer nickname. :PSure! Dudes happy with us, look at that smile xD Idk how well it summaries. The anchor tries to pin the 300 number on the government which is not true and talks like the civilians are entitled a briefing on a military operation. There is a very obvious  bias in the narrative being pushed.I'm Pakistani. It's still partially closed. Some airports are open for domestic flights, but no international flights have yet been allowed. It's being said that normal flight operations will resume from 4th March. It should. I have a lot of relatives that are stuck ._. No international flights at all. It's kinda worrisome tho, at least for me. I don't think we're on high alert anymore except LoC. So why close the entire country's airspace? What about India? Is the airspace completely open?Man I really don't know why it's closed lelI'm a normal guy who's afraid of dying. Fuel shortage? O.o who's saying that? There isn't no fuel shortage, not any that I'm aware of. You got any links to where people are saying that?Lol yesterday he tweeted that Pakistan has killed scores of Indian officer by sniping them. He is a rumor mongerer. The evidence can be used by jihadis for recruitment purposes. When has our military ever lied to us? Pak mil is a deep state within itself and has a history of hiding facts from pak public. Don't fall for pak propaganda. And in 2030 the pak mil will finally acknowledge their soldier who died fighting for his country and give him some sort of award... You know cuz pak mil has a standard 10 years period before they acknowledge their soldiers sacrifice like in the kargil and 1971 wars. The cost of supporting terrorism has to be increased for pak.... Pak is the epicenter of terrorism.... If it becomes hard to Pakistan to train terrorists.... It will have an effect world wideCommon man 40 years of diplomacy achieved nothing... Time to adopt new methodThey are blackmailing you.... Our countrymen will die horrible deaths at the hands of these terrorists for the next 40 years more if we don't act nowThey have to be countered on all front. Limited military action was absolutely nessesary and it has to become the norm now so that Pakistan knows the blackmail it is doing by putting a gun to its own head... One day or another it may have to actually pull the trigger.Edit : BTW wow what ideal view of geopolitics you haveRe edit.: I did not mean that as attack on you... I am just saying your view is quite idealisticIt doesn't matter.... Has our military ever conducted itself in a non professional manner in the 70 years of history.... Their reputation is such that we can take their statements as truth. National security cannot be compromised like that plus the enemy will also learn of confidential spy satellite capabilities...And he has already said that the pak authorities Mentally harassed him when he was in their costody This should be pinned for better visibility Lol just because a few publications came out with articles that did not bash Pakistan doesn't mean Pakistan has come out looking like a good guy.... The whole world condemned the pulwama attack.... USA France UK all came out with statement that they supported India's right to defend itself..... Not a single country said anything against India after the airstrike...not even China....infact France EU and USA asked Pakistan to do more to combat terrorism after the airstrike to de escalate tension. Pakistan is utterly isolated...even IOc ignored Pakistan after the airstrike... Sushma swaraj was the chief guest while Pakistan FM was sulking at home. It released our pilot within 48 hours and it did not do it out of self will... Otherwise quereshi wouldn't be in front camera trying to justify to pak public why they released the pilot without any deal from India. Erdogen may have some reason to stick with Pakistan. Pakistani here. He did not shoot down any of our jets. These are just claims by your media without any proof. The only proof that was bought up was a picture of a destroyed jet engine, that too was debunked by a specialist on India today. Regardless, he is still a hero as he fought for his country and you guys should be proud of him.Uhhh what ? Our army never claimed or did any surgical strikes in 2016. That was your army (that claimed to do so that too without any proof much like this time) in retaliation to an attack that they blamed on Pakistan (similarly without any proof, what you said about the leopard is true after all).I don't bring up local and biased news sources because they do just that. Make BS up to glorify their nation. And you did exactly that. Regardless it's very much possible that this strike did happen and our forces are lying, I'm ready to entertain this possibility even with the proof being shady at best. Hoping your public would do so too.Which one ? They lied about the air strike 300 dead bodies were 3 trees at best. Every single international and neutral report indicates that no damage was done to the madrassah in the area. Hell, they didn't even make it to Balakot.It's funny because I'm living in the country where the army has major influence on media and how our history is written, but even then we are skeptical of their claims and whenever they try to feed us some bs. Your public doesn't even seem to be questioning this whole fiasco.Nope.As credible as the Francesco Marino person is IMO. Abhijit Iyer the guy all the Pakistanis are praising since yesterday (The F16 guy) has said about her, "FYI Francesca scouted there extensively &amp; spent time in a Pakistani prison. Her sources are IMPECCABLE". So Pakistanis at least should believe this report (I kid, I kid). But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.This is goldThere's a chance he might have downed an F16 so yeah ....Lol except Turkey not a single country has condemned India for it's attack on Pakistan or praised Pakistan for it's response. They are a rogue state like North Korea and no sane country wants to side with them in this against India, not even China.And a terrorist getting killed should not be seen as a success for the ruling govt? Just like a terrorist attack happening should not be seen as a failure for the ruling govt? Tell me what do you think the ruling govt does in this country?Dude your army lied about the 2016 surgical strikes too. That's why no one believes them when they lie about these strikes. After all a leopard doesn't change it's spots.The Indian army truthfully claimed that the surgical strikes happened, Pakistan denied it outright and you Pakistanis lapped it up. Well unfortunately for you in 2018 the Indian govt released proof of the surgical strike happening and for whatever reason most Pakistanis seem to be unaware about the proof being released, ignorance is bliss I daresay.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/watch-when-indian-army-destroyed-terrorist-launchpads-in-pok-surgical-strike-1271879-2018-06-28https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/video-proof-of-2016-surgical-strike-surfaces/videoshow/64785042.cmsJust watch the videos, it's an official video released at the same time by the government to all media channels. This ain't propaganda, this is proof. And now I hope you remember 2016 when PAkistan made a big hue and cry about how no strikes happened. That was for 2 reasons which still hold true todayIt dents the image of the Pakistani armed forces and pisses off the Mullahs who feel that they weren't properly defended by the army and makes them decide to attack the army.It increases the pressure on the army to respond against India, especially if they actually release evidence of dead bodies and blown up buildings.That is why the Pakistani army would rather lie to their public about it. And no, most Indians aren't going to mistrust their army and would need a lot of proof to not believe anything the official spokesperson of the army puts out. That's because our army doesn't have a history of lying to us and has no ulterior motives or lust for power.The difference between truth and fiction.That is logical but also serves their purpose.Only handful of local journalists visited place and that too under heavy military restrictions. They must have shown places around where there was not much collateral damage.Remember reports were coming out from local journalists that  they cordoned off the madarasa area immediately and did not let anyone enter not even local police.I think had there been visit from swarm of international journalists they could not have stood the pressure and journalists would have demanded unfettered access to the site. Refusal to do so would have resulted in negative international press coverage.Closing the airspace seems obvious way to thwart above scenario. Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 days.&gt; Closing airspace doesn't stop foreign journalists that are already in the country from visiting the site. Which there are likely many of.&gt; &gt; Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.Still it does not explain restricted access to the site. Attack happened on 26th and I see following article of decision to close airspace on 27th. Sufficient enough to stop somebody from planning international flight.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-closes-airspace-suspends-flights-amid-escalating-tensions-2000211&gt; Some airports are **open for domestic flights**, but **no international flights** have yet been allowedFear of international journalist coming in and demanding access to bombed madarasa site ? To stop *hostile* foreign journalist from coming in ? This seems actually more of a possibility than SAM precautionary measure Its ridiculous isnt it? Although I cant clearly see whats happening in the video, the commentary says 2 pilots so that means either SU30 or 2seater F16. 2 jets were downed that day the other jet is a fucking mystery! Did it just disappear into thin air? Im more inclined to believe it is to stop swarm of journalist coming into the countrywhat? that's pretty significant!He is fighting for our country and for us which brought him to an enemy territory, thats an instant hero and massive amount of well wishes for his safety and return from the public. Many like me had a feeling of dread when I say his captured photographs. I wish I can share the pain and humiliation he faced at the hands of the enemy and the dread especially when the locals tricked him into saying he is Indian pilot, thats must have been  dreadful.Its very simple, if you do not realize he is a hero then you will never realize. Exactly, that one guy said why India not releasing the before after satellite images. IDK how stupid he can be, why would the military want to give away our surveillance capabilities just to prove a point?That too at 1 am in the nightDamn some people really are denseI feel they don't want foreign journalists swarming BalakotI feel they don't want foreign journalists swarming Balakot. What do you think?Yep but the cleanup is already doneCorrect and took a dig on the people who got in it's (sale) wayDo you really feel that if the pakis had downed a sukhoi, they would've had been quite about this?I did a little side investigation and found the latest images on mainstream websites to be atleast 6 mithd old (lol) but google it. Some organisation already did it and they seem to have found results whoch are available in their article. This however, also is the article that the pakis seem to be parading and obviously its a private organisation so there's next to no credibility. Oh and the coordinates are available on wikipedia. If you find a way, do check for yourself tooI am getting a feeling that this whole dialysis thing is a sham and he got injured in the strikes (referring to the ISI story of Col Salim)Yeah but its an endless loophole then. The world then believes that we did nothing and it all comes back to square one (whether we should release evidence or not)&gt;Has our military ever conducted itself in a non professional manner in the 70 years of historyI never disputed that. I believe that it isn't even in my ability to do so considering how much they've done for us. But, international outlook also matters and I'm not blaming anyone here. Im just putting things as they are, like here is a problem. Solve it.Exactly what I've been trying to convince the subreddit for the past 2 days. I'd face a really bloody war head on, rather than suffering this faux "peace" for another 70 years.&gt; But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.**?????**Could be. But reports are coming they will fully open their Air space by tomorrow.yeah and Air space is open now. LOLI know Urdu and he said, his camps were recruits trained for Jehad was Bombed.&gt;  It's still partially closed.But why have they closed it? According to official narrative of DGISPR, India's Air raid on 26th Feb was dud and harmed nothing but some trees and Pakistan's raid of 27th Feb was much more successful thus implying Pakistan is far more superior air power. So why this knee jerk reaction contradicting triumphant official claims?And second thing I wanted to ask is about Fuel shortage in Pakistan as some claims going on SM. Is it true? If so, then why?OK. Don't worry, things are settling and normalcy should return in Pak soon. Man, I'm also normal guy, who's afraid of dying but these routine terror attacks have exhausted our patience and somber nature. We all here are afraid to die but if terrorism continued this way, then we will surely die sooner than later. That's the reason why were we Indian's rattling sabers in past few days but no hard feelings for Pakistani people in general.  &gt;  ISI storyWhich story?It wasn't the delay. It was the heavily edited video that came out moments before his release. Don't know why Pakistan felt it needed to do it. Lost a lot of goodwill as a result. &gt; Why does the video matter so much when the guy can contradict with that as soon as he is going to cross over?  Look, I was the first to mention that there were a lot of Pakistanis asking that Abhinandan be treated well. I was genuinely moved by it. But, moments before his release, there's this  video - where it looks like he's been coerced - so you start to feel that you can't really trust Pakistan. On one hand there's talk of peace gesture and on the other there's manipulation.I understand your point. Plus, I don't think its worth going to war over. My feeling about it is to the extent that I can't trust everything Pakistan says. I will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution.  We are thankful that he's back home. There's a lot of one-upping going on here and having a reasonable debate will be hard. Again, I am thankful Pakistan released him, but the video did do a damage to the trust of even the faithfully liberal person.&amp;#x200B;But but when international media and analysis pointing other way. At some point you need to tell the whole world. It's not like you have some serious supersecret facility. You claim to bomb the terrorist facility in other country.  What's the purpose of claiming and not showing anything. Edit : if India possesses any technology that's not open to world then I am up for it. But again there's proof floating that there is no damage done. I am behind my govt but if something starts to smell as propaganda I WILL question. Why this username reminds me of my neighboring country!  OK.  My username is same in CS:GO.Let's meet sometime,  you will play terrorist and I will play counter terrorist. Deal? Let elections come near like 10 days to go!! WTF Mama elections Ottoman Empire lol ===Figure of 300 hundred was made out of thin air by media  ,but 35 still seems like realistic number.Another claim was 1000 kg bomb was dropped...Man ,How shit media is -_+===  Kandahar hijack happened to free Azhar Masood...not sure what else proof is required ..Country which defines terrorists as good terrorists and bad terrorists. ...You can expect sanity from them.Very disheartening to hear that you people require proof for a very well documented terrorist head to take action against him.Several security council members accept the proof but it is not enough for Pak? Does Pak have higher standards to declare someone a terrorist? Or does India have so much influence that majority will blindly agree with her? You say JeM is banned? Why is it banned? Is it banned because it is a terrorist organisation? If so dont you think its members need to be arrested?Hey buddy, since you constantly post here, what is your opinion on your FM accepting that your country allows JeM to operate AKA harbours terrorists?As for the hypocrisy, yes it was very hypocritical. It was a propoganda video similar to what NK makes.Killed in prison by criminals who are rotting in prison. Now what do you think should we do? Those people are already on a life term, and in history of India very few people have been executed. People here already condemned it, but we didnt know his mortal remains were being returned today since there was no big announcement.Yes. Between a source and a journalist.Normal satellites don't work in sensitive zones. So relying Open Source Intelligence is really not gonna take you anywhere in this case. A few hours ago there was a report from credible journalist from her sources in Pakistan on WIONews. You don't have to take her word or mine for it. She did say that she is expecting a video from the strike site. Lets see.In the meantime, you should listen to this if you haven't already.https://twitter.com/i/status/1101837054533648384This is the video for the news coverage I was talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkVsIaN2VlsYou cheeky bastard. :)Yeah I saw that Interview almost when it surfaced but apparently Pakistani individuals are not ready to accept the propaganda their country is playing with them. Its sad. They say they are victims of terrorism too the way they act, it doesn't seem like one.Fuck they celebrated the death of soldiers and they have the gall to call us ignorant. I remember very crisply on 13th Feb a Pakistani individual was appreciating the beauty of our nation on /r/india. On 14th Feb we lost 40+ brave. By night Pakistan was celebrating. On 15th we had an apology from another Pakistani who claimed to come from a military family and told us about their rogue army. Their Army General lies to their population with a straight face without breaking a sweat. They don't have the gall to accept defeat. I in these few weeks have come to an understanding that its not their Military that is retarded its the general population. Living there they have lost touch of reality. His brain at full threshold can only handle 2 words in 3 seconds. So that's why the delay. Let me assure you he is trying his best. /sEven though you have created a very detailed report of events I see bias. 1. You are ignoring that your General was adamant to lay this fact to everyone that no F16 was used whatsoever. He never mentioned which Aircrafts were used. Such misinformation has not been spread on one but multiple occasion by Pakistan's officials.2. You say the JF-17 deployed flares even though its entirely possible that the R73 must have hit the jet.3. Air surveillance in such sensitive zones can tell with  certainty what hit who.4. You are assuming that Pakistan's Air Force was there to just violate the Indian Air Space and bomb non military installation, however its entirely possible Pakistan had a full blown Air Assault in mind against the Indian Army's forward posts. In that case I don't think F16 would have done a better job from Pakistani Air Space.5. You are also not making sense with electronic data. Even though they were 2nd Gen aircraft the radar and other technology are kept up to date by Air Force standards. India's Joint Chiefs said they only lost a MIG-21 but some people saw two pilots eject from another jet. That could have been the F16. Given the stakes it would have made sense for Pakistan Air Force to lie, due to two reason : a MIG-21 shooting down a F16 and going against the US's end user agreement. Are you for real ? What does such a highly propagated video indicates ? If you still can't see I honestly have no hope for you.Oh thank you for giving us our braveheart back alive. It really is a big deal to make it out alive from Pakistan isn't it?Your Prime Minister made a really good gesture in this tense moment but ruined it all by whichever parties were involved in making those propaganda videos.There was another Pakistani saying I was ignorant. These alleged event did happen. So did 26/11, Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama.You are right. Absolutely right, Peace keeping is not always done with diplomatic talks, many a times peace requires finishing rogue factors.Kill Azhar. Do it. They're updated only every few months for most locations.Doesn't hurt to ask if somebody has access to such a service through their work or something. I'm trying to sign up on Planet Labs where you can explore a bit for free.Pick one: The Mig took down a F16 or the Mig is a flying coffin. What result is he talking about? Is it a 100% given that a Rafale couldn't have been shot down?Hindi news channels: Hamare sapoot ka lie detector test kiya gaya... /sa rival hindi channel: aisa lagta hai unhe current laga ke torture kiya gaya hai... /sIt was Pakistan who first broke the news of India's air strike, not India. First get your facts straight and then talk.Looks like you are really smart. How would you have explained Pakistan's retaliation?
