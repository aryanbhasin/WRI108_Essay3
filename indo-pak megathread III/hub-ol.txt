This seems actually more of a possibility than SAM precautionary measure It’s ridiculous isn't it? Although I can’t clearly see what's happening in the video, the commentary says 2 pilots so that means either SU30 or 2seater F16. 2 jets were downed that day the other jet is a fucking mystery! Did it just disappear into thin air? I’m more inclined to believe it is to stop swarm of journalist coming into the countrywhat? that's pretty significant!He is fighting for our country and for us which brought him to an enemy territory, thats an instant hero and massive amount of well wishes for his safety and return from the public. Many like me had a feeling of dread when I say his captured photographs. I wish I can share the pain and humiliation he faced at the hands of the enemy and the dread especially when the locals tricked him into saying he is Indian pilot, thats must have been  dreadful.It’s very simple, if you do not realize he is a hero then you will never realize. Exactly, that one guy said why India not releasing the before after satellite images. IDK how stupid he can be, why would the military want to give away our surveillance capabilities just to prove a point?That too at 1 am in the nightDamn some people really are denseI feel they don't want foreign journalists swarming BalakotI feel they don't want foreign journalists swarming Balakot. What do you think?Yep but the cleanup is already doneLol yesterday he tweeted that Pakistan has killed scores of Indian officer by sniping them. He is a rumor mongerer. The evidence can be used by jihadis for recruitment purposes. When has our military ever lied to us? Pak mil is a deep state within itself and has a history of hiding facts from pak public. Don't fall for pak propaganda. And in 2030 the pak mil will finally acknowledge their soldier who died fighting for his country and give him some sort of award... You know cuz pak mil has a standard 10 years period before they acknowledge their soldiers sacrifice like in the kargil and 1971 wars. The cost of supporting terrorism has to be increased for pak.... Pak is the epicenter of terrorism.... If it becomes hard to Pakistan to train terrorists.... It will have an effect world wideCommon man 40 years of diplomacy achieved nothing... Time to adopt new methodThey are blackmailing you.... Our countrymen will die horrible deaths at the hands of these terrorists for the next 40 years more if we don't act nowThey have to be countered on all front. Limited military action was absolutely nessesary and it has to become the norm now so that Pakistan knows the blackmail it is doing by putting a gun to its own head... One day or another it may have to actually pull the trigger.Edit : BTW wow what ideal view of geopolitics you haveRe edit.: I did not mean that as attack on you... I am just saying your view is quite idealisticIt doesn't matter.... Has our military ever conducted itself in a non professional manner in the 70 years of history.... Their reputation is such that we can take their statements as truth. National security cannot be compromised like that plus the enemy will also learn of confidential spy satellite capabilities...And he has already said that the pak authorities Mentally harassed him when he was in their costody This should be pinned for better visibility Lol just because a few publications came out with articles that did not bash Pakistan doesn't mean Pakistan has come out looking like a good guy.... The whole world condemned the pulwama attack.... USA France UK all came out with statement that they supported India's right to defend itself..... Not a single country said anything against India after the airstrike...not even China....infact France EU and USA asked Pakistan to do more to combat terrorism after the airstrike to de escalate tension. Pakistan is utterly isolated...even IOc ignored Pakistan after the airstrike... Sushma swaraj was the chief guest while Pakistan FM was sulking at home. It released our pilot within 48 hours and it did not do it out of self will... Otherwise quereshi wouldn't be in front camera trying to justify to pak public why they released the pilot without any deal from India. Erdogen may have some reason to stick with Pakistan. Finally an Indian ex-Foreign minister to compete with Pakistan's in the most idiotic comments Olympics.*Shalom*, you called?Nawazuddin Siddiqui as ganjedi Railway Minister.This is hilarious. Even better than this onehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZr5dx57RG0&amp;feature=youtu.beFractal trollingYour username is hilarious. I think it describes Pakistani media just perfectly :)Their radar systems can't handle too many moving targets at a time. So by shutting their airspace, they expect to be able to identify any Indian air force planes coming in for a hit more easily.Yes. Between a source and a journalist.Normal satellites don't work in sensitive zones. So relying Open Source Intelligence is really not gonna take you anywhere in this case. A few hours ago there was a report from credible journalist from her sources in Pakistan on WIONews. You don't have to take her word or mine for it. She did say that she is expecting a video from the strike site. Lets see.In the meantime, you should listen to this if you haven't already.https://twitter.com/i/status/1101837054533648384This is the video for the news coverage I was talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkVsIaN2VlsYou cheeky bastard. :)Yeah I saw that Interview almost when it surfaced but apparently Pakistani individuals are not ready to accept the propaganda their country is playing with them. Its sad. They say they are victims of terrorism too the way they act, it doesn't seem like one.Fuck they celebrated the death of soldiers and they have the gall to call us ignorant. I remember very crisply on 13th Feb a Pakistani individual was appreciating the beauty of our nation on /r/india. On 14th Feb we lost 40+ brave. By night Pakistan was celebrating. On 15th we had an apology from another Pakistani who claimed to come from a military family and told us about their rogue army. Their Army General lies to their population with a straight face without breaking a sweat. They don't have the gall to accept defeat. I in these few weeks have come to an understanding that it’s not their Military that is retarded it’s the general population. Living there they have lost touch of reality. His brain at full threshold can only handle 2 words in 3 seconds. So that's why the delay. Let me assure you he is trying his best. /sEven though you have created a very detailed report of events I see bias. 1. You are ignoring that your General was adamant to lay this fact to everyone that no F16 was used whatsoever. He never mentioned which Aircrafts were used. Such misinformation has not been spread on one but multiple occasion by Pakistan's officials.2. You say the JF-17 deployed flares even though it’s entirely possible that the R73 must have hit the jet.3. Air surveillance in such sensitive zones can tell with  certainty what hit who.4. You are assuming that Pakistan's Air Force was there to just violate the Indian Air Space and bomb non military installation, however its entirely possible Pakistan had a full blown Air Assault in mind against the Indian Army's forward posts. In that case I don't think F16 would have done a better job from Pakistani Air Space.5. You are also not making sense with electronic data. Even though they were 2nd Gen aircraft the radar and other technology are kept up to date by Air Force standards. India's Joint Chiefs said they only lost a MIG-21 but some people saw two pilots eject from another jet. That could have been the F16. Given the stakes it would have made sense for Pakistan Air Force to lie, due to two reason : a MIG-21 shooting down a F16 and going against the US's end user agreement. Are you for real ? What does such a highly propagated video indicates ? If you still can't see I honestly have no hope for you.Oh thank you for giving us our braveheart back alive. It really is a big deal to make it out alive from Pakistan isn't it?Your Prime Minister made a really good gesture in this tense moment but ruined it all by whichever parties were involved in making those propaganda videos.There was another Pakistani saying I was ignorant. These alleged event did happen. So did 26/11, Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama.You are right. Absolutely right, Peace keeping is not always done with diplomatic talks, many a times peace requires finishing rogue factors.Kill Azhar. Do it. yeah, lets go back in history and quote unrelated 'alleged' events to the present scenarioSame, if you want to remain stuck on the video, instead of looking at the bigger picture that you got your guy aliveI could google several events where you were the bad guys at a certain turn of history and quote here, but what would be the point? The gesture of releasing him was about peace. Not finding and then stuck onto imperfections in those actsWhat I did, all those comments, it wasn't for them, I did it for me, I guess. I have been having identity crisis, and events like these only make it clear where I belong. I thought of myself as someone who could acknowledge good or bad, irrespective of their national background, think critically, but I see hatred winning over every single battle and it's pointless to debate when majority in the world just want one over you to win an argument, rather than going for objectivity.This is true for my own countrymen as well, but seeing myself &amp; few others, as people who could take a saner perspective when shit hits the fan here, I thought may be I could find myself among them, but I was so wrong. I don't suppose this would make sensePakistan is the hypocrite as it made a video of the guy who it saved from mob lynching and was about to hand over, sure. What do you think about the body of Pakistani prisoner who was killed in your prison?Why does the video matter so much when the guy can contradict with that as soon as he is going to cross over? May be some people just need an excuse to hate othersWhat part of not killing the guy you don't understand? If a 'coerced' video of him make Pakistan look ingenuine, then may be it's lost to give peace another chance. May as well go to war, since there will always be people unhappy about the semantics of things being done for peace.What were the jail authorities doing when the inmates were stoning our guy? Guess, he didn't get saved like your pilot who was attacked by our mob.I don't expect an investigation into it regarding why this happened, or who overlooked the safety of him as that would only anger your extremists. Despite being called a terrorist nation, sanity still prevailed here. You can't make everyone happy. If it weren't the video, people may have jumped upon why he wasn't sent via air. Or why wasn't he saved earlier. Or why wasn't he fed pizza. It's useless to make such things an excuse when at the end of the day, what matters most, is we returned your guy alive. With all the extremism my country has, I think it was an achievement on our part. It's not a competition, but i expected better than a body in response.So are mobs, but guess what? Sanity prevailed and the armed officers, of the same army you criticize for the cuts, saved him from lynching. I wonder what Geneva conventions say about not giving a fuck about the enemy fighter jet pilot, who crossed the border in a bid to target the locals there only to find being torn apart by their hands.I am not sure why Pakistan is shittiing bricks, some twitter handles are saying ,we are ready with Missiles. Saw a needy program where they said "India has modified planes to look like commercial crafty and then attack Pakistan". Looks like they are sure that we are going to attack them.  Dude seriously ? Ok let me try explaining, a soldier leaves his loved ones behind and goes  to war to defend his motherland, did his duty without any fear, conducted himself with grace under fire and comes back . What is he if not a hero. At his play I would have said anything to appease my captor's, but he held his grace. For me he is a hero as is any other soldier who is giving his everything for meDude NO, don't give them fucking ideas! .all please downvote this comment..Mere delay ? It was not that he had taken a loan and he needed to close that before he leaves Pakistan. You had all the time to film him with 17 cuts but not release him ,oh and you wanted him to be released with all pump and show to humiliate him. The way camera was panning of his face by your Camera operator's says it all. We are sorry about Pakistani being killed in jail but then jail's are not filled with rational people.I guess this fact of " beating by locals" can be taken from the guy who as per your spokesman " is in hospital" , wonder what happened to him also wonder what happened to the 2 jets you shot. Geneva convention or not , you returned him , thanks but don't take a moral high ground of being a country where everyone is a peace loving hippie. You are a Terrorist state and you know it. Jihadi country to be specific.Had he been killed by your Jihadi country men with clips on special Media then (a) International community would have taught you a lesson (b) India would have made you shit bricks . Because in that case no one could have justified a NO WAR tagline.Lets see what happens in the polls. It will hopefully give a clear picture of the national sentiment, Western countries are also keeping mum. LOL! No. Its hard to find something trustworthy but NDTV is not to be trusted for sure. I would be very reserved about generalizing western media when that itself has so many internal divides. Pakistan may have come across as sensible in this particular instance but youre forgetting that the problem leaderships of the world have is with terrorism. Pakistan has not been able to solve the problem! One can be sympathetic to a country only so much and so many times. Even if IK means the change Pakistan is hoping for, the expectations from him are quite crazy. And anyway, international media does not run world leaderships. Frankly who the fuck can thump their chests and say what exactly happened in the strike? No one. Image aside, an aspect of politics that matters clearly seems to operate with facts that arent completely shared with the public it seems.If what Gen. Bakshi says is true then Pakistan needs to be held responsible for war crimes, not invited to ceremonies of prizes. Sat what you may about him, Bakshi has seen war at close quarters and might know a thing or two. Guy on left gives no fucks about war or peace, he just wanna be high and wasted!You are kidding right? Such assumption is baseless and frankly quite stupid on their part. Nope.As credible as the Francesco Marino person is IMO. Abhijit Iyer the guy all the Pakistanis are praising since yesterday (The F16 guy) has said about her, "FYI Francesca scouted there extensively &amp; spent time in a Pakistani prison. Her sources are IMPECCABLE". So Pakistanis at least should believe this report (I kid, I kid). But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.This is goldThere's a chance he might have downed an F16 so yeah ....Lol except Turkey not a single country has condemned India for it's attack on Pakistan or praised Pakistan for it's response. They are a rogue state like North Korea and no sane country wants to side with them in this against India, not even China.And a terrorist getting killed should not be seen as a success for the ruling govt? Just like a terrorist attack happening should not be seen as a failure for the ruling govt? Tell me what do you think the ruling govt does in this country?Dude your army lied about the 2016 surgical strikes too. That's why no one believes them when they lie about these strikes. After all a leopard doesn't change it's spots.The Indian army truthfully claimed that the surgical strikes happened, Pakistan denied it outright and you Pakistanis lapped it up. Well unfortunately for you in 2018 the Indian govt released proof of the surgical strike happening and for whatever reason most Pakistanis seem to be unaware about the proof being released, ignorance is bliss I daresay.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/watch-when-indian-army-destroyed-terrorist-launchpads-in-pok-surgical-strike-1271879-2018-06-28https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/video-proof-of-2016-surgical-strike-surfaces/videoshow/64785042.cmsJust watch the videos, it's an official video released at the same time by the government to all media channels. This ain't propaganda, this is proof. And now I hope you remember 2016 when PAkistan made a big hue and cry about how no strikes happened. That was for 2 reasons which still hold true todayIt dents the image of the Pakistani armed forces and pisses off the Mullahs who feel that they weren't properly defended by the army and makes them decide to attack the army.It increases the pressure on the army to respond against India, especially if they actually release evidence of dead bodies and blown up buildings.That is why the Pakistani army would rather lie to their public about it. And no, most Indians aren't going to mistrust their army and would need a lot of proof to not believe anything the official spokesperson of the army puts out. That's because our army doesn't have a history of lying to us and has no ulterior motives or lust for power.The difference between truth and fiction.that's it? >#=huh? that isn't a sensitive area otherwise you would never get any pictures. but we do have pictures which means it isn't sensitive/blocked by google. he said we were being targetted. as in they were the goal, that doesn't mean they were hit. it's been said many times that there was a madressa in that area but missed by few kilometres. wasn't promptly closed. 2 days after is when it closed, when pak caught indian pilot and there were news of a possible attack.fyi reuter, independent and washington post have articles out. try reading them. not a single one supports indian narrative. Attack happened on the 25th actually. Flights were stopped on the day of pilot arrest when escalation was happening.FYI some Indian airports were closed the same day too. &gt;"Srinagar, Jammu and Leh airports were among five airports closed on Wednesday for civilian air traffic shortly after an IAF [Indian Air Force] jet crashed in Kashmirs Budgam district," the Press Trust of India, a news agency reported.Really? As a Pakistani, when I read NDTV twitter comments, they are usually getting bashed. I thought maybe they're biased. im being sarcastic. i mean seriously? we are going off what "eye witness" said now? how the fuck do you know there was a ISI agent or ek-pak army killed? amount of delusion is insane to believe that but not give any attention to satellite verification conducted independently. no one can erase that proof, not pakistan nor india. https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/were-indias-airstrikes-in-pakistan-a-strategy-for-public-approval/because pakistan never denied his existence in pakistan or acknowledged him as a terrorist. what exactly is the big deal? we already know pakistan doesn't acknowledge him as one otherwise there would be a legitimate case for india intl to ask why he isn't in jail. not pakistan. and as the minister claims here, it was supposedly conveyed to him that JeM denied involvement. i think indians need to realize that whether you call them terrorist sor not it doesn't matter. it matters if pakistan does and they dont so there is no "blunder" in what the minister has said here. i dont know why indians are so delusional. setting your own goal posts that you know you can achieve even if they make no sense. pakistan never denied jem existence in pakistan so what is the big deal? pakistan has confessed their contact with azhar masood, not jem. learn to differentiate organization with individual&gt;No country will share details of their military operations and that includes US who has scarcely given details about their counter terrorist ops in past and present.no one is asking for military details. this is a bombing, you can easily prove it by satellite images which won't compromise any military details. &gt; If Pakistan so staunchly believes that no terrorists are being raised on it's soil, why are you hell bent on asking for a proof?because u keep crying about it. being a neighbour country, we have to look into your reservations. or you think we should ignore you? that would be better?he didn't say that. jem is banned, not azhar mehmood. how is it very well documented if you have no proof? yes we require proof, we will not do something just because you said so. likewise we don't expect you to do anything just because we said so. its illogical. Has there ever been an opposition so weak?But don't all countries except china already accept JeM as a terrorist organisation? and after them taking responsibility for pulwama attack i don't understand why this isn't a bigger issue. They talk like we're just speculating this shit with no proof. It doesn't matter if pakistan doesn't want to acknowledge them as a terrorist group, but if they accept they house them there should be more pressure to hand over him to us. Shit like this is the reason i stand behind government's decision of being more bold against them (still don't want any war tho)How do news channels not run clips like this 24*7 is something i'll never understandOur army has never given a reason to not trust them on the other hand yours...NDTV is the most trusted and most unbiased of all media houses.Last night he claimed several Indian soldiers have been taken out by Paki Snipers and India in retaliation started shelling with the MBRL. According to 'sources' ofcourse. I chose to stay away from these unverified intelligence handles for my own sanity.Yeah! Modi just pitched the urgent need for the Rafale Jets.It was about calling out the hypocrisy in Pakistan's peace gesture.Mostly because they suspect another escalation from India and it seems PAF utilises civilian airports for its operationsIts happened on 3:30 am on 26 the febYou don't chose to be a hero, you got selected as heroThese rumours are getting worse than football transfer rumoursNo war have been fought till today? Ending terrorism would need a full scale invasion like America did to Afghanistan , India ,now and not in future would be able to mount that type of invasion Yeah it should ,and as before diplomacy would be the way , terrorism exist for the reason , and reason is people have invested in it to exist I think it just a business model to keep India and Pakistan on brink of war.35 sounds believableGeneral Elections of 2019 will answer them.Yes, let me call my friend at ISRO.This comment! ANI tweeted the same a while before:  https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1101826679037743104 Indian airspace is completely open and operating normally. Northern airports was closed for an hour on the day when PAF tried to enter Indian airspace.And that was all.Correct and took a dig on the people who got in it's (sale) wayDo you really feel that if the pakis had downed a sukhoi, they would've had been quite about this?I did a little side investigation and found the latest images on mainstream websites to be atleast 6 mithd old (lol) but google it. Some organisation already did it and they seem to have found results whoch are available in their article. This however, also is the article that the pakis seem to be parading and obviously its a private organisation so there's next to no credibility. Oh and the coordinates are available on wikipedia. If you find a way, do check for yourself tooI am getting a feeling that this whole dialysis thing is a sham and he got injured in the strikes (referring to the ISI story of Col Salim)Yeah but its an endless loophole then. The world then believes that we did nothing and it all comes back to square one (whether we should release evidence or not)&gt;Has our military ever conducted itself in a non professional manner in the 70 years of historyI never disputed that. I believe that it isn't even in my ability to do so considering how much they've done for us. But, international outlook also matters and I'm not blaming anyone here. Im just putting things as they are, like here is a problem. Solve it.Exactly what I've been trying to convince the subreddit for the past 2 days. I'd face a really bloody war head on, rather than suffering this faux "peace" for another 70 years.Bermuda triangle.Honestly I believe in our army's F-16 story.PkmkbBetter than Salman khanOttoman Empire lol ===Figure of 300 hundred was made out of thin air by media  ,but 35 still seems like realistic number.Another claim was 1000 kg bomb was dropped...Man ,How shit media is -_+===  Kandahar hijack happened to free Azhar Masood...not sure what else proof is required ..Country which defines terrorists as good terrorists and bad terrorists. ...You can expect sanity from them.Very disheartening to hear that you people require proof for a very well documented terrorist head to take action against him.Several security council members accept the proof but it is not enough for Pak? Does Pak have higher standards to declare someone a terrorist? Or does India have so much influence that majority will blindly agree with her? You say JeM is banned? Why is it banned? Is it banned because it is a terrorist organisation? If so dont you think its members need to be arrested?Hey buddy, since you constantly post here, what is your opinion on your FM accepting that your country allows JeM to operate AKA harbours terrorists?As for the hypocrisy, yes it was very hypocritical. It was a propoganda video similar to what NK makes.Killed in prison by criminals who are rotting in prison. Now what do you think should we do? Those people are already on a life term, and in history of India very few people have been executed. People here already condemned it, but we didnt know his mortal remains were being returned today since there was no big announcement.That is logical but also serves their purpose.Only handful of local journalists visited place and that too under heavy military restrictions. They must have shown places around where there was not much collateral damage.Remember reports were coming out from local journalists that  they cordoned off the madarasa area immediately and did not let anyone enter not even local police.I think had there been visit from swarm of international journalists they could not have stood the pressure and journalists would have demanded unfettered access to the site. Refusal to do so would have resulted in negative international press coverage.Closing the airspace seems obvious way to thwart above scenario. Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 days.&gt; Closing airspace doesn't stop foreign journalists that are already in the country from visiting the site. Which there are likely many of.&gt; &gt; Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.Still it does not explain restricted access to the site. Attack happened on 26th and I see following article of decision to close airspace on 27th. Sufficient enough to stop somebody from planning international flight.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-closes-airspace-suspends-flights-amid-escalating-tensions-2000211&gt; Some airports are **open for domestic flights**, but **no international flights** have yet been allowedFear of international journalist coming in and demanding access to bombed madarasa site ? To stop *hostile* foreign journalist from coming in ? &gt; But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.**?????**Could be. But reports are coming they will fully open their Air space by tomorrow.yeah and Air space is open now. LOLI know Urdu and he said, his camps were recruits trained for Jehad was Bombed.&gt;  It's still partially closed.But why have they closed it? According to official narrative of DGISPR, India's Air raid on 26th Feb was dud and harmed nothing but some trees and Pakistan's raid of 27th Feb was much more successful thus implying Pakistan is far more superior air power. So why this knee jerk reaction contradicting triumphant official claims?And second thing I wanted to ask is about Fuel shortage in Pakistan as some claims going on SM. Is it true? If so, then why?OK. Don't worry, things are settling and normalcy should return in Pak soon. Man, I'm also normal guy, who's afraid of dying but these routine terror attacks have exhausted our patience and somber nature. We all here are afraid to die but if terrorism continued this way, then we will surely die sooner than later. That's the reason why were we Indian's rattling sabers in past few days but no hard feelings for Pakistani people in general.  &gt;  ISI storyWhich story?Sure in that case it should have been a covert operation. Why make it public if it's supposed to be classified? If you do make it public for whatever reasons (cough elections cough) then people have every right to ask for proofYes but India could have denied it. Instead bjp ran posters taking creditThanks, I read a lot. Pakistanis wouldn't have had to retaliate if we weren't boastingWatching his BBC interview yesterday made me think of how similar he is to boman irani.A ) this isn't keeping it covert. This is obscenely public. If that's the idea then it should have been a covert operation from the startB) time has passed since surgical strike 1, where is the proof for that?Yeah. You never admit to covert operation publiclyHow about all the Indian soliders Pakistanis beheaded leading into the kargil war?But but when international media and analysis pointing other way. At some point you need to tell the whole world. It's not like you have some serious supersecret facility. You claim to bomb the terrorist facility in other country.  What's the purpose of claiming and not showing anything. Edit : if India possesses any technology that's not open to world then I am up for it. But again there's proof floating that there is no damage done. I am behind my govt but if something starts to smell as propaganda I WILL question. Why this username reminds me of my neighboring country!  OK.  My username is same in CS:GO.Let's meet sometime,  you will play terrorist and I will play counter terrorist. Deal? Let elections come near like 10 days to go!! WTF Mama elections And what does real life offer? Nuclear war between two retarded nations?Just wait for the 2020 Bollywood rendition where he jumps out of his MiG on to a Pakistani F-16 and bitch slaps the Pakistani pilot into oblivion. Then he jumps back into his plane only to be dropped into Pakistani territory but he manages to survive immense torture from the Pakistani army. Afterwards, he slips past them and escapes to India on foot killing three whole battalions with a 9 MM. The movie stars Ajay Devgan as Abhinandan and Boman Irani as the evil Pakistani Foreign Minister.Dont get your panties all twisted, its my Dota 2 and CS:GO gamer nickname. :PSure! Dudes happy with us, look at that smile xD Are bhai, their foreign minister has the balls to go on BBC and claim that JeM involvement not confirmed in pulwama Attack. Highly recommend you watch that interview! He pretty much gives the whole game away!Dont ever expect honesty or truth from this part of the world, they have a deeply ingrained insecurity that allows them to perversely rationalize every aspect of their nations behaviour.World is not = to global media. Are you high?Paks 2 biggest allies stood by and watched India be the aggressor for the first time ever and did nothing.. UN Security Council March petition to designate Azhar as global terrorist is still going to happen. If you want to cherrypick articles from known ultra liberal publications (no offence to them, am a liberal myself), thats your choice. But the facts are evident from the actions (or lack thereof) that global powers have undertaken in response to this conflict. Hey Lahori guy, welcome! People who live in glass houses should not throw Osama Bin Ladens. Oops!! I meant stones! Equally damning? I certainly dont think so.One side tried and arguably failed to eliminate a dangerous threat, the other has spilled the beans (directly and indirectly) that they harbour and maybe even support these groups.. I know which one Id take..Because god made them that wayYeah , imagine a Boeing carrying bombs like a bomber and a FUCKING BrahMos tipped with a goddamn nuclear warhead for shits and giggles . That is gonna cause some lethal damage my friend >#>#>#>#That is Pak's F16I just gave examples of those two incidents. I do believe in both things but Pakistan never accepted killing of Osama and there are many countries which still doubt moon landing. Good thing is most people in US never doubted in what they were told by govt. Point is Pakistan govt and media can keep denying Osama killing, Surgical strike, air strike, F16 forever but that doesn't change the truth for rest of the world.International media like CNN, BBC are famously associated with certain ideology. I personally find most stories of NYT and WSJ fair and neutral. It is not in business interest of many countries and parties that India, Pakistan become friends and grow together.NDTV is one of the most biased media houses of India but than so is every other channel.News portals have chosen their camps Right, Left or center. Money, power and Ideology being the deciding factor.International media will never want India / Pakistan to come together and solve issues after all we buy most weapons. This kind of difference news game has been always played in past too specifically during war like sceneorios like this one but it looks more today due to social media and reach of internet.The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc.In India not just the airspace is open but world's largest gathering "Kumbh" is going peacefully in Prayagraj, Australia is playing matches peacefully, Hero Football league is going on, Modi, Shah, Rahul are doing election campaign, our PM is not even taking calls from Pakistan.Pak govt has never accepted Osama killing, surgical strikes, for many years Kargil war they will take few decades to accept Air Strike.Number may not be 300 killed at Balakot but if IAF entered in Pak and dropped bombs that is a big deal and changes India's responses to future possible attacks. If govt had done this after Mumbai attacks that would have been best. 'Al Qaeda is banned, not Osama bin Laden'.What's the point then?&gt; If some substantial thing happens about killing terrorists, etc, media will project it as a success for Modi.And some in social media will project it as being manufactured by Modi / Doval.Common citizens rarely know much about defense matters so most people don't realize the significance or what a bad situation the IAF's inventory is in.All those things on Wg cmdr Abhinandan's chest are chest leads used to take an ECG. Probably as a part of routine medical checkup.Renal failure or air strikes?CID team at Wagah borderACP Pradhyuman : Daya, darwaza tod do!No need to write the /s , they'll actually do that.CID officer Vivek on the job.
