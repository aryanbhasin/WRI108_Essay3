10,123,1,That is Pak's F16
10,43,1,"I just gave examples of those two incidents. I do believe in both things but Pakistan never accepted killing of Osama and there are many countries which still doubt moon landing. Good thing is most people in US never doubted in what they were told by govt. Point is Pakistan govt and media can keep denying Osama killing, Surgical strike, air strike, F16 forever but that doesn't change the truth for rest of the world.International media like CNN, BBC are famously associated with certain ideology. I personally find most stories of NYT and WSJ fair and neutral. It is not in business interest of many countries and parties that India, Pakistan become friends and grow together."
10,56,1,"NDTV is one of the most biased media houses of India but than so is every other channel.News portals have chosen their camps Right, Left or center. Money, power and Ideology being the deciding factor.International media will never want India / Pakistan to come together and solve issues after all we buy most weapons. This kind of difference news game has been always played in past too specifically during war like sceneorios like this one but it looks more today due to social media and reach of internet.The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc."
10,86,1,"In India not just the airspace is open but world's largest gathering ""Kumbh"" is going peacefully in Prayagraj, Australia is playing matches peacefully, Hero Football league is going on, Modi, Shah, Rahul are doing election campaign, our PM is not even taking calls from Pakistan.Pak govt has never accepted Osama killing, surgical strikes, for many years Kargil war they will take few decades to accept Air Strike.Number may not be 300 killed at Balakot but if IAF entered in Pak and dropped bombs that is a big deal and changes India's responses to future possible attacks. If govt had done this after Mumbai attacks that would have been best. "

18,102,1,Yeah. You never admit to covert operation publicly
18,119,1,How about all the Indian soliders Pakistanis beheaded leading into the kargil war?
19,42,1,Yes. Between a source and a journalist.
19,56,1,"Normal satellites don't work in sensitive zones. So relying Open Source Intelligence is really not gonna take you anywhere in this case. A few hours ago there was a report from credible journalist from her sources in Pakistan on WIONews. You don't have to take her word or mine for it. She did say that she is expecting a video from the strike site. Lets see.In the meantime, you should listen to this if you haven't already.https://twitter.com/i/status/1101837054533648384This is the video for the news coverage I was talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkVsIaN2Vls"
19,58,1,You cheeky bastard. :)
19,67,1,"Yeah I saw that Interview almost when it surfaced but apparently Pakistani individuals are not ready to accept the propaganda their country is playing with them. Its sad. They say they are victims of terrorism too the way they act, it doesn't seem like one.Fuck they celebrated the death of soldiers and they have the gall to call us ignorant. I remember very crisply on 13th Feb a Pakistani individual was appreciating the beauty of our nation on /r/india. On 14th Feb we lost 40+ brave. By night Pakistan was celebrating. On 15th we had an apology from another Pakistani who claimed to come from a military family and told us about their rogue army. Their Army General lies to their population with a straight face without breaking a sweat. They don't have the gall to accept defeat. I in these few weeks have come to an understanding that its not their Military that is retarded its the general population. Living there they have lost touch of reality. "
19,70,1,"His brain at full threshold can only handle 2 words in 3 seconds. So that's why the delay. Let me assure you he is trying his best. /s"
19,117,1,"Even though you have created a very detailed report of events I see bias. 1. You are ignoring that your General was adamant to lay this fact to everyone that no F16 was used whatsoever. He never mentioned which Aircrafts were used. Such misinformation has not been spread on one but multiple occasion by Pakistan's officials.2. You say the JF-17 deployed flares even though its entirely possible that the R73 must have hit the jet.3. Air surveillance in such sensitive zones can tell with  certainty what hit who.4. You are assuming that Pakistan's Air Force was there to just violate the Indian Air Space and bomb non military installation, however its entirely possible Pakistan had a full blown Air Assault in mind against the Indian Army's forward posts. In that case I don't think F16 would have done a better job from Pakistani Air Space.5. You are also not making sense with electronic data. Even though they were 2nd Gen aircraft the radar and other technology are kept up to date by Air Force standards. India's Joint Chiefs said they only lost a MIG-21 but some people saw two pilots eject from another jet. That could have been the F16. Given the stakes it would have made sense for Pakistan Air Force to lie, due to two reason : a MIG-21 shooting down a F16 and going against the US's end user agreement. "
19,119,4,"Are you for real ? What does such a highly propagated video indicates ? If you still can't see I honestly have no hope for you.Oh thank you for giving us our braveheart back alive. It really is a big deal to make it out alive from Pakistan isn't it?Your Prime Minister made a really good gesture in this tense moment but ruined it all by whichever parties were involved in making those propaganda videos.There was another Pakistani saying I was ignorant. These alleged event did happen. So did 26/11, Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama.You are right. Absolutely right, Peace keeping is not always done with diplomatic talks, many a times peace requires finishing rogue factors.Kill Azhar. Do it. "
20,5,1,"Why? What good would that do? Do u think Pakistan govt doesn't know what actually happened? Same with all other world nations. We criticise modi for using this to get votes. "
21,18,2,"It was Pakistan who first broke the news of India's air strike, not India. First get your facts straight and then talk.Looks like you are really smart. How would you have explained Pakistan's retaliation? "
22,27,1,*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** chaha-pohe! ^(hug)
23,49,1,Thanks!
24,117,1,"I wrote a wall of text in response and deleted it as pointless. India claim to have a kill but there is no proof. But India officialdom didn't claim photo evidence of the F16, internettors did. In your own narrative, F16s are involved so Pak officialdom lied.Did Indian strikes succeed - we don't know. But people in the know point to Pakistan's photos of the craters and trees and say that a \*missed\* explosion from the SPICE 2000 won't just produce a crater, it will defoliate nearby trees. And Pak still hasn't let anyone tour the actual madrasa site, nor zoomed out on the craters they did photo, to show the scale of the explosion. **Edit**: let me put it this way, 10 guys with shovels could have produced those particular ""craters"" in an hour.In the larger scheme of things, India called the nuclear bluff and attacked Pak territory in response to a terrorist attack that they believe - and the organization JeM took responsibility for - was organized in Pakistan. Will this happen again if there is another attack - I believe so.For me personally, watching that final video of WC Abhinandan put out by Pak officially - seemed like one of those ISIS and Saddam videos where you capture someone and make them sing their captor's praises. I have some colorful language but that would get me banned on this particular sub. Suffice to say it was revolting. Your country just isn't worth the time, for me, anymore."
25,29,1,Also the fact that Pakistan did the exact same thing in return as well turned it into a dud.
26,56,1,"'Al Qaeda is banned, not Osama bin Laden'.What's the point then?"
26,109,1,"&gt; If some substantial thing happens about killing terrorists, etc, media will project it as a success for Modi.And some in social media will project it as being manufactured by Modi / Doval."
26,112,1,Common citizens rarely know much about defense matters so most people don't realize the significance or what a bad situation the IAF's inventory is in.
27,39,2,"That is logical but also serves their purpose.Only handful of local journalists visited place and that too under heavy military restrictions. They must have shown places around where there was not much collateral damage.Remember reports were coming out from local journalists that  they cordoned off the madarasa area immediately and did not let anyone enter not even local police.I think had there been visit from swarm of international journalists they could not have stood the pressure and journalists would have demanded unfettered access to the site. Refusal to do so would have resulted in negative international press coverage.Closing the airspace seems obvious way to thwart above scenario. Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 days.&gt; Closing airspace doesn't stop foreign journalists that are already in the country from visiting the site. Which there are likely many of.&gt; &gt; Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.Still it does not explain restricted access to the site. "
27,56,1,"Attack happened on 26th and I see following article of decision to close airspace on 27th. Sufficient enough to stop somebody from planning international flight.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pakistan-closes-airspace-suspends-flights-amid-escalating-tensions-2000211"
27,83,1,"&gt; Some airports are **open for domestic flights**, but **no international flights** have yet been allowedFear of international journalist coming in and demanding access to bombed madarasa site ? "
27,125,1,To stop *hostile* foreign journalist from coming in ? 
28,2,1,"Lets see what happens in the polls. It will hopefully give a clear picture of the national sentiment, Western countries are also keeping mum. "
28,49,1,LOL! No. Its hard to find something trustworthy but NDTV is not to be trusted for sure. 
28,60,1,"I would be very reserved about generalizing western media when that itself has so many internal divides. Pakistan may have come across as sensible in this particular instance but youre forgetting that the problem leaderships of the world have is with terrorism. Pakistan has not been able to solve the problem! One can be sympathetic to a country only so much and so many times. Even if IK means the change Pakistan is hoping for, the expectations from him are quite crazy. And anyway, international media does not run world leaderships. Frankly who the fuck can thump their chests and say what exactly happened in the strike? No one. Image aside, an aspect of politics that matters clearly seems to operate with facts that arent completely shared with the public it seems."
28,70,1,"If what Gen. Bakshi says is true then Pakistan needs to be held responsible for war crimes, not invited to ceremonies of prizes. Sat what you may about him, Bakshi has seen war at close quarters and might know a thing or two. "
28,126,1,"Guy on left gives no fucks about war or peace, he just wanna be high and wasted!"
28,100,1,You are kidding right? 
28,106,1,Such assumption is baseless and frankly quite stupid on their part. 
29,43,1,"Kind of died down except our keyboard warriors and stupid bjp since most of the evidence suggests the airstrikes were a dud and they captured our pilot. The PR went against us after the initial euphoria.Even if it was a dud the fact that IAF went so far into Pak territory and dropped bombs would have been a strong signal nonetheless but the media and the social media warriors have fucked up big time and turned this into a dud.

37,21,1,"The air forces haven't made any specific claims other that ""they achieved their objectives"". The questioning is targeting the claims made by the BJP government which has consistently been lying to the country ever since they came into power. After all the false claims regarding demonetization, GDP, etc I think it's fair to not trust them. "
38,119,3,"Bhai they completely ignored your point.  Koi faida nahi. Not one person spoke about the murdered Pakistani.  Everyone is worried about the 5 hour delay. Inko apnay haal pay rehne deyMakes perfect sense. But in the end, people would say anything to one up each other and ignore the main point. Nobody thinks anything of the murdered Pakistani. Lmao they keep ignoring you"
39,27,3,"If you suspect military action, then the responsible thing to do would be to close civilian airspace wouldn't it?Closing airspace doesn't stop foreign journalists that are already in the country from visiting the site. Which there are likely many of.Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.&gt;Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 daysWhich is miniscule compared to a civilian liner getting shot down by rogue SAM launches.Not everything has to be a conspiracy.&gt; restricted access to the site.It was a terrorist camp, one under Pakistan's nose that it publicly denied. Regardless of it being destroyed or not, Pakistan would not want foreign journalists digging through the place confirming that it was a training camp for terrorists."
39,51,1,He said images from commercial satellites.
39,88,1,The professor in this video echoed my feelings on this as a westerner observing this from afar.
40,95,1,It's still a 60 year old airframe 2nd gen fighter. the F-16 outclasses it in every way regardless of the upgrades you put on it. There's a reason why the USA doesn't fly F-100's with modern electronics 
41,70,1,"&gt; The anchor tries to pin the 300 number on the government which is not true and talks like the civilians are entitled a briefing on a military operation.What!? Where in the video did those two things happen?"
42,123,1,Nope.
42,127,2,"As credible as the Francesco Marino person is IMO. Abhijit Iyer the guy all the Pakistanis are praising since yesterday (The F16 guy) has said about her, ""FYI Francesca scouted there extensively &amp; spent time in a Pakistani prison. Her sources are IMPECCABLE"". So Pakistanis at least should believe this report (I kid, I kid). But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.This is gold"
42,124,1,There's a chance he might have downed an F16 so yeah ....
42,100,1,"Lol except Turkey not a single country has condemned India for it's attack on Pakistan or praised Pakistan for it's response. They are a rogue state like North Korea and no sane country wants to side with them in this against India, not even China."
42,109,1,And a terrorist getting killed should not be seen as a success for the ruling govt? Just like a terrorist attack happening should not be seen as a failure for the ruling govt? Tell me what do you think the ruling govt does in this country?
42,111,3,"Dude your army lied about the 2016 surgical strikes too. That's why no one believes them when they lie about these strikes. After all a leopard doesn't change it's spots.The Indian army truthfully claimed that the surgical strikes happened, Pakistan denied it outright and you Pakistanis lapped it up. Well unfortunately for you in 2018 the Indian govt released proof of the surgical strike happening and for whatever reason most Pakistanis seem to be unaware about the proof being released, ignorance is bliss I daresay.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/watch-when-indian-army-destroyed-terrorist-launchpads-in-pok-surgical-strike-1271879-2018-06-28https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/video-proof-of-2016-surgical-strike-surfaces/videoshow/64785042.cmsJust watch the videos, it's an official video released at the same time by the government to all media channels. This ain't propaganda, this is proof. And now I hope you remember 2016 when PAkistan made a big hue and cry about how no strikes happened. That was for 2 reasons which still hold true todayIt dents the image of the Pakistani armed forces and pisses off the Mullahs who feel that they weren't properly defended by the army and makes them decide to attack the army.It increases the pressure on the army to respond against India, especially if they actually release evidence of dead bodies and blown up buildings.That is why the Pakistani army would rather lie to their public about it. And no, most Indians aren't going to mistrust their army and would need a lot of proof to not believe anything the official spokesperson of the army puts out. That's because our army doesn't have a history of lying to us and has no ulterior motives or lust for power."
42,116,1,The difference between truth and fiction.
43,10,1,"&gt;The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc.What the fuck are you going on about?

56,130,1,that's it? >#=
56,19,1,"huh? that isn't a sensitive area otherwise you would never get any pictures. but we do have pictures which means it isn't sensitive/blocked by google. he said we were being targetted. as in they were the goal, that doesn't mean they were hit. it's been said many times that there was a madressa in that area but missed by few kilometres.

56,27,2,"wasn't promptly closed. 2 days after is when it closed, when pak caught indian pilot and there were news of a possible attack.fyi reuter, independent and washington post have articles out. try reading them. not a single one supports indian narrative. Attack happened on the 25th actually. Flights were stopped on the day of pilot arrest when escalation was happening.FYI some Indian airports were closed the same day too. &gt;""Srinagar, Jammu and Leh airports were among five airports closed on Wednesday for civilian air traffic shortly after an IAF [Indian Air Force] jet crashed in Kashmirs Budgam district,"" the Press Trust of India, a news agency reported."

56,51,1,"im being sarcastic. i mean seriously? we are going off what ""eye witness"" said now? how the fuck do you know there was a ISI agent or ek-pak army killed? amount of delusion is insane to believe that but not give any attention to satellite verification conducted independently. no one can erase that proof, not pakistan nor india. https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/were-indias-airstrikes-in-pakistan-a-strategy-for-public-approval/"

56,87,1,"i dont know why indians are so delusional. setting your own goal posts that you know you can achieve even if they make no sense. pakistan never denied jem existence in pakistan so what is the big deal? pakistan has confessed their contact with azhar masood, not jem. learn to differentiate organization with individual&gt;No country will share details of their military operations and that includes US who has scarcely given details about their counter terrorist ops in past and present.no one is asking for military details. this is a bombing, you can easily prove it by satellite images which won't compromise any military details. &gt; If Pakistan so staunchly believes that no terrorists are being raised on it's soil, why are you hell bent on asking for a proof?because u keep crying about it. being a neighbour country, we have to look into your reservations. or you think we should ignore you? that would be better?"
56,99,2,"he didn't say that. jem is banned, not azhar mehmood. how is it very well documented if you have no proof? yes we require proof, we will not do something just because you said so. likewise we don't expect you to do anything just because we said so. its illogical. "
57,54,1,"Yes, let me call my friend at FBI."
58,21,1,"But but when international media and analysis pointing other way. At some point you need to tell the whole world. It's not like you have some serious supersecret facility.

58,126,1,WTF 
58,91,1,Mama elections 
59,121,1,"Looks like they're really sweeping out the terrorists, sleeper cells, it is a difficult situation to people of Kashmir."
60,28,1,"No he is not kidding.  Even though Pakistan overall has a worse image in the international community, Pakistan has come out looking like the more sensible state in this specific episode.  India claimed surgical strikes which international community did not object to but then presented no evidence that even 1 militant was killed.  The international social media was retweeting pictures of trees being hit.  Then there were images of Indian jet wreckage and also a live Indian pilot sipping tea with Pakistan army.All this while Imran Khan kept pleading for peace and Modi was making delayed empty statements. Modi's tactics backfired and India lost the PR battle and this is what most articles on western media outlets reflected.  This isn't to say Pakistan overall has the better image around the world, it doesn't but in this instance they came out looking better.  At the very least in the eyes of the international public."
60,97,1,"Dogfighting is all about positioning.  Whoever gets behind has a massive advantage, even if their aircraft is inferior.  If F-16s were on the run then a Mig 21 can shoot it from behind, same can be said of a Pakistani Mirage shooting down Sukhoi 30 in retreat, it doesn't say much about the pilots capability if that is the case."
61,56,1,Its happened on 3:30 am on 26 the feb
61,124,1,"You don't chose to be a hero, you got selected as hero"
61,72,3,"These rumours are getting worse than football transfer rumoursNo war have been fought till today? Ending terrorism would need a full scale invasion like America did to Afghanistan , India ,now and not in future would be able to mount that type of invasion Yeah it should ,and as before diplomacy would be the way , terrorism exist for the reason , and reason is people have invested in it to exist I think it just a business model to keep India and Pakistan on brink of war."
61,131,1,35 sounds believable
62,10,1,"Check sources for other news channels and Ndtv channel. While other channels are relying on information from twitter handles. Ndtv is discussing things through the information provided by Indian defence during press conference.Also please go through IAF press conference on 2nd day with reports published on news channels. You will find out that there is over exaggeration on all the news channels other than NDTV. "
62,85,1,"India is changing narrative from victory to intention. First day govt leaked it to media that around 300 people killed. Next day Indian pilot caught by Pakistan and Indian defence had to do a press briefing in this they claimed its immature to assume casualties. Now international official sources have confirmed that India had intelligence to the target but we did not hit the target. If we have to put fear in Pakistan we have to show our capability by hitting them right on target not by showing our  intent or chest thumping with unverified numbers. "
63,110,1,"I think the same, but international media have no reason to think so.They need to provide evidence to convince other people. "
64,102,1,"The Indian government is refusing to provide evidence, therefore the Pakistanis are liars.Wah. Just brilliant."
65,14,1,And the fact that he thought of swallowing those documents. Showed real composure throughout. He did not seem to crack under pressure and did his job right. 
65,122,1,It's really hard to give ABP news credibility after that shit storm they've pulled. 
65,119,1,All we're saying is that releasing that edited video serves nothing good for either country. And Pakistan would've been in big trouble if they killed the WC.
66,35,1,Has there ever been an opposition so weak?
66,56,1,"But don't all countries except china already accept JeM as a terrorist organisation? and after them taking responsibility for pulwama attack i don't understand why this isn't a bigger issue. They talk like we're just speculating this shit with no proof. It doesn't matter if pakistan doesn't want to acknowledge them as a terrorist group, but if they accept they house them there should be more pressure to hand over him to us. Shit like this is the reason i stand behind government's decision of being more bold against them (still don't want any war tho)"
66,71,1,How do news channels not run clips like this 24*7 is something i'll never understand
66,111,1,Our army has never given a reason to not trust them on the other hand yours...

70,88,1,"Idk how well it summaries. The anchor tries to pin the 300 number on the government which is not true and talks like the civilians are entitled a briefing on a military operation. There is a very obvious  bias in the narrative being pushed."
71,117,1,"Bruh, I know this is a theory but damn, this makes perfect sense. You good. Let's see if we get more info.&gt;Pakistan denied using F-16s in the operation, said it was JF-17s.I don't think they said it was JF17s, iirc they only said F-16s weren't used. "
72,35,1,Lol yesterday he tweeted that Pakistan has killed scores of Indian officer by sniping them. He is a rumor mongerer. 
72,49,1,The evidence can be used by jihadis for recruitment purposes. When has our military ever lied to us? Pak mil is a deep state within itself and has a history of hiding facts from pak public. Don't fall for pak propaganda. 
72,50,1,And in 2030 the pak mil will finally acknowledge their soldier who died fighting for his country and give him some sort of award... You know cuz pak mil has a standard 10 years period before they acknowledge their soldiers sacrifice like in the kargil and 1971 wars. 
72,61,2,"The cost of supporting terrorism has to be increased for pak.... Pak is the epicenter of terrorism.... If it becomes hard to Pakistan to train terrorists.... It will have an effect world wideCommon man 40 years of diplomacy achieved nothing... Time to adopt new method"

I am just saying your view is quite idealistic"
72,91,2,"It doesn't matter.... Has our military ever conducted itself in a non professional manner in the 70 years of history....

72,98,2,"And he has already said that the pak authorities Mentally harassed him when he was in their costody This should be pinned for better visibility "
72,100,1,Lol just because a few publications came out with articles that did not bash Pakistan doesn't mean Pakistan has come out looking like a good guy.... The whole world condemned the pulwama attack.... USA France UK all came out with statement that they supported India's right to defend itself..... Not a single country said anything against India after the airstrike...not even China....infact France EU and USA asked Pakistan to do more to combat terrorism after the airstrike to de escalate tension. Pakistan is utterly isolated...even IOc ignored Pakistan after the airstrike... Sushma swaraj was the chief guest while Pakistan FM was sulking at home. It released our pilot within 48 hours and it did not do it out of self will... Otherwise quereshi wouldn't be in front camera trying to justify to pak public why they released the pilot without any deal from India. Erdogen may have some reason to stick with Pakistan.

Pakistan should be fighting against the terrorists it allows and encourages to operate against India. But there is no solution, except diplomacy, that wouldnt kill millions. A better solution would be to isolate Pakistan. Encourage the rest of the world to recognize Pakistan as a sponsor of terrorism. Boycott and cut them off. Make them a pariah state that they should have been after 9/11. Sure, theyll lash out with more attacks. But eventually (hopefully) their citizens will push for their government to do something about the camps on their soil. But military action against Pakistan will lead to untold suffering in both countries.

106,99,1,  Kandahar hijack happened to free Azhar Masood...not sure what else proof is required ..Country which defines terrorists as good terrorists and bad terrorists. ...You can expect sanity from them.
107,70,1,I saw it at 1.5 speed and he's still slow. 
108,21,1,"But we are so used to such video footage since the gulf war in the 90s.  Pakis using this opportunity. Im not for war, but whenever there is intel report on training camp in pok  we should attack preemptively and govt shouldnt chest thump it. "
109,43,2,"[https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976](https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976)Even, as per this report [https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf), the firing / tension in LoC to continue until May elections. If some substantial thing happens about killing terrorists, etc, media will project it as a success for Modi.Yes, both countries won't go for war."
110,63,1,"Air Force won't lie ..if it's caught it goes under severe scrutiny. People lose jobs .. if it's unsuccessful they would just say that.  There are things that surely we should be critical about and ask proof for but not this. I support Air Force and I believe what they announced. I don't care if you guys think I am bakth or whatever ..I completely trust my Army and I rely on them ..hell I am sleeping well tonight based on same trust. I wouldn't doubt it a second."
110,105,1,Mate can you get any sat imagery of Balakot?
111,14,1,"Pakistani here. He did not shoot down any of our jets. These are just claims by your media without any proof. The only proof that was bought up was a picture of a destroyed jet engine, that too was debunked by a specialist on India today. Regardless, he is still a hero as he fought for his country and you guys should be proud of him."
111,42,2,"Uhhh what ? Our army never claimed or did any surgical strikes in 2016. That was your army (that claimed to do so that too without any proof much like this time) in retaliation to an attack that they blamed on Pakistan (similarly without any proof, what you said about the leopard is true after all).I don't bring up local and biased news sources because they do just that. Make BS up to glorify their nation. And you did exactly that. Regardless it's very much possible that this strike did happen and our forces are lying, I'm ready to entertain this possibility even with the proof being shady at best. Hoping your public would do so too."
111,45,1,"Which one ? They lied about the air strike 300 dead bodies were 3 trees at best. Every single international and neutral report indicates that no damage was done to the madrassah in the area. Hell, they didn't even make it to Balakot.It's funny because I'm living in the country where the army has major influence on media and how our history is written, but even then we are skeptical of their claims and whenever they try to feed us some bs. Your public doesn't even seem to be questioning this whole fiasco."
112,106,1,Slight digression but I think it would've been terrible to go to war without 42 IAF squadrons ready. 
113,98,1,He admitted to being targeted but not that they were hit. This is damning for both countries. It pretty much alludes that India tried but failed to attack their camps and it alludes that Pakistan lies about JeMs presence in the area.
114,129,1,Did he sleep?
114,117,1,Ok
115,25,1,But they didn't target our buildings. That's what they announced to the media. Unlike ours. 
116,42,1,"&gt; But honestly in these reports it's basically the fact that she'll lose all credibility and her livelihood if found to be true that basically are the proof for it.**?????**"
116,51,2,"Could be. But reports are coming they will fully open their Air space by tomorrow.yeah and Air space is open now. LOL"
116,75,1,"I know Urdu and he said, his camps were recruits trained for Jehad was Bombed."
116,83,2,"&gt;  It's still partially closed.But why have they closed it? According to official narrative of DGISPR, India's Air raid on 26th Feb was dud and harmed nothing but some trees and Pakistan's raid of 27th Feb was much more successful thus implying Pakistan is far more superior air power. So why this knee jerk reaction contradicting triumphant official claims?And second thing I wanted to ask is about Fuel shortage in Pakistan as some claims going on SM. Is it true? If so, then why?OK. Don't worry, things are settling and normalcy should return in Pak soon. Man, I'm also normal guy, who's afraid of dying but these routine terror attacks have exhausted our patience and somber nature. We all here are afraid to die but if terrorism continued this way, then we will surely die sooner than later. That's the reason why were we Indian's rattling sabers in past few days but no hard feelings for Pakistani people in general.  "
116,91,1,"&gt;  ISI storyWhich story?"
117,71,1,Credits go to u/DegnerOshold
118,35,1,Because god made them that way
118,120,1,"Yeah , imagine a Boeing carrying bombs like a bomber and a FUCKING BrahMos tipped with a goddamn nuclear warhead for shits and giggles . That is gonna cause some lethal damage my friend >#>#>#>#"
119,18,1,"yeah, lets go back in history and quote unrelated 'alleged' events to the present scenario"
119,19,2,"Same, if you want to remain stuck on the video, instead of looking at the bigger picture that you got your guy aliveI could google several events where you were the bad guys at a certain turn of history and quote here, but what would be the point? The gesture of releasing him was about peace. Not finding and then stuck onto imperfections in those acts"
119,38,1,"What I did, all those comments, it wasn't for them, I did it for me, I guess. I have been having identity crisis, and events like these only make it clear where I belong. I thought of myself as someone who could acknowledge good or bad, irrespective of their national background, think critically, but I see hatred winning over every single battle and it's pointless to debate when majority in the world just want one over you to win an argument, rather than going for objectivity.This is true for my own countrymen as well, but seeing myself &amp; few others, as people who could take a saner perspective when shit hits the fan here, I thought may be I could find myself among them, but I was so wrong. I don't suppose this would make sense"
119,49,1,"Pakistan is the hypocrite as it made a video of the guy who it saved from mob lynching and was about to hand over, sure. What do you think about the body of Pakistani prisoner who was killed in your prison?"
119,98,2,"Why does the video matter so much when the guy can contradict with that as soon as he is going to cross over? May be some people just need an excuse to hate othersWhat part of not killing the guy you don't understand? If a 'coerced' video of him make Pakistan look ingenuine, then may be it's lost to give peace another chance. May as well go to war, since there will always be people unhappy about the semantics of things being done for peace."
119,99,1,"What were the jail authorities doing when the inmates were stoning our guy? Guess, he didn't get saved like your pilot who was attacked by our mob.I don't expect an investigation into it regarding why this happened, or who overlooked the safety of him as that would only anger your extremists. Despite being called a terrorist nation, sanity still prevailed here. "
119,100,1,"You can't make everyone happy. If it weren't the video, people may have jumped upon why he wasn't sent via air. Or why wasn't he saved earlier. Or why wasn't he fed pizza. It's useless to make such things an excuse when at the end of the day, what matters most, is we returned your guy alive. With all the extremism my country has, I think it was an achievement on our part. It's not a competition, but i expected better than a body in response."
119,120,1,"So are mobs, but guess what? Sanity prevailed and the armed officers, of the same army you criticize for the cuts, saved him from lynching. I wonder what Geneva conventions say about not giving a fuck about the enemy fighter jet pilot, who crossed the border in a bid to target the locals there only to find being torn apart by their hands."
120,35,1,"I am not sure why Pakistan is shittiing bricks, some twitter handles are saying ,we are ready with Missiles. Saw a needy program where they said ""India has modified planes to look like commercial crafty and then attack Pakistan"". Looks like they are sure that we are going to attack them. "
120,124,1," Dude seriously ? Ok let me try explaining, a soldier leaves his loved ones behind and goes  to war to defend his motherland, did his duty without any fear, conducted himself with grace under fire and comes back . What is he if not a hero. At his play I would have said anything to appease my captor's, but he held his grace. For me he is a hero as is any other soldier who is giving his everything for me"
120,97,1,"Dude NO, don't give them fucking ideas! .all please downvote this comment.."
120,119,3,"Mere delay ? It was not that he had taken a loan and he needed to close that before he leaves Pakistan. You had all the time to film him with 17 cuts but not release him ,oh and you wanted him to be released with all pump and show to humiliate him. The way camera was panning of his face by your Camera operator's says it all. We are sorry about Pakistani being killed in jail but then jail's are not filled with rational people.I guess this fact of "" beating by locals"" can be taken from the guy who as per your spokesman "" is in hospital"" , wonder what happened to him also wonder what happened to the 2 jets you shot. Geneva convention or not , you returned him , thanks but don't take a moral high ground of being a country where everyone is a peace loving hippie. You are a Terrorist state and you know it. Jihadi country to be specific.Had he been killed by your Jihadi country men with clips on special Media then (a) International community would have taught you a lesson (b) India would have made you shit bricks . Because in that case no one could have justified a NO WAR tagline."
121,35,1,Some high level banter comments on that thread.
