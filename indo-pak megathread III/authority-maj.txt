I am not sure why Pakistan is shittiing bricks, some twitter handles are saying ,we are ready with Missiles. Saw a needy program where they said "India has modified planes to look like commercial crafty and then attack Pakistan". Looks like they are sure that we are going to attack them.  Dude seriously ? Ok let me try explaining, a soldier leaves his loved ones behind and goes  to war to defend his motherland, did his duty without any fear, conducted himself with grace under fire and comes back . What is he if not a hero. At his play I would have said anything to appease my captor's, but he held his grace. For me he is a hero as is any other soldier who is giving his everything for meDude NO, don't give them fucking ideas! .all please downvote this comment..Mere delay ? It was not that he had taken a loan and he needed to close that before he leaves Pakistan. You had all the time to film him with 17 cuts but not release him ,oh and you wanted him to be released with all pump and show to humiliate him. The way camera was panning of his face by your Camera operator's says it all. We are sorry about Pakistani being killed in jail but then jail's are not filled with rational people.I guess this fact of " beating by locals" can be taken from the guy who as per your spokesman " is in hospital" , wonder what happened to him also wonder what happened to the 2 jets you shot. Geneva convention or not , you returned him , thanks but don't take a moral high ground of being a country where everyone is a peace loving hippie. You are a Terrorist state and you know it. Jihadi country to be specific.Had he been killed by your Jihadi country men with clips on special Media then (a) International community would have taught you a lesson (b) India would have made you shit bricks . Because in that case no one could have justified a NO WAR tagline.Its happened on 3:30 am on 26 the febYou don't chose to be a hero, you got selected as heroThese rumours are getting worse than football transfer rumoursNo war have been fought till today? Ending terrorism would need a full scale invasion like America did to Afghanistan , India ,now and not in future would be able to mount that type of invasion Yeah it should ,and as before diplomacy would be the way , terrorism exist for the reason , and reason is people have invested in it to exist I think it just a business model to keep India and Pakistan on brink of war.35 sounds believableYou do realize youre advocating for a solution that would likely kill a billion, if not two billion, right? Pakistan should be fighting against the terrorists it allows and encourages to operate against India. But there is no solution, except diplomacy, that wouldnt kill millions. A better solution would be to isolate Pakistan. Encourage the rest of the world to recognize Pakistan as a sponsor of terrorism. Boycott and cut them off. Make them a pariah state that they should have been after 9/11. Sure, theyll lash out with more attacks. But eventually (hopefully) their citizens will push for their government to do something about the camps on their soil. But military action against Pakistan will lead to untold suffering in both countries. War wont make it better, just much worse and faster. Credits go to u/DegnerOshold[https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976](https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976)Even, as per this report [https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf), the firing / tension in LoC to continue until May elections. If some substantial thing happens about killing terrorists, etc, media will project it as a success for Modi.Yes, both countries won't go for war.Has there ever been an opposition so weak?But don't all countries except china already accept JeM as a terrorist organisation? and after them taking responsibility for pulwama attack i don't understand why this isn't a bigger issue. They talk like we're just speculating this shit with no proof. It doesn't matter if pakistan doesn't want to acknowledge them as a terrorist group, but if they accept they house them there should be more pressure to hand over him to us. Shit like this is the reason i stand behind government's decision of being more bold against them (still don't want any war tho)How do news channels not run clips like this 24*7 is something i'll never understandOur army has never given a reason to not trust them on the other hand yours...Yes, let me call my friend at MOSSAD.Sure in that case it should have been a covert operation. Why make it public if it's supposed to be classified? If you do make it public for whatever reasons (cough elections cough) then people have every right to ask for proofYes but India could have denied it. Instead bjp ran posters taking creditThanks, I read a lot. Pakistanis wouldn't have had to retaliate if we weren't boastingWatching his BBC interview yesterday made me think of how similar he is to boman irani.A ) this isn't keeping it covert.

Northern airports was closed for an hour on the day when PAF tried to enter Indian airspace.And that was all.Are bhai, their foreign minister has the balls to go on BBC and claim that JeM involvement not confirmed in pulwama Attack. Highly recommend you watch that interview! He pretty much gives the whole game away!Dont ever expect honesty or truth from this part of the world, they have a deeply ingrained insecurity that allows them to perversely rationalize every aspect of their nations behaviour.World is not = to global media. Are you high?Paks 2 biggest allies stood by and watched India be the aggressor for the first time ever and did nothing.. UN Security Council March petition to designate Azhar as global terrorist is still going to happen. If you want to cherrypick articles from known ultra liberal publications (no offence to them, am a liberal myself), thats your choice. But the facts are evident from the actions (or lack thereof) that global powers have undertaken in response to this conflict. Hey Lahori guy, welcome! People who live in glass houses should not throw Osama Bin Ladens. Oops!! I meant stones! Equally damning? I certainly dont think so.One side tried and arguably failed to eliminate a dangerous threat, the other has spilled the beans (directly and indirectly) that they harbour and maybe even support these groups.. I know which one Id take..I think the same, but international media have no reason to think so.They need to provide evidence to convince other people. Who is "thrashing" Pakistan ?hahaha this made my dayThanks!Bhai they completely ignored your point.  Koi faida nahi. Not one person spoke about the murdered Pakistani.  Everyone is worried about the 5 hour delay. Inko apnay haal pay rehne deyMakes perfect sense. But in the end, people would say anything to one up each other and ignore the main point. Nobody thinks anything of the murdered Pakistani. Lmao they keep ignoring youThe thing is that there is no evidence available that IAF hit any of those military camps, so the western media is not believing ithttps://www.newslaundry.com/2019/02/28/a-look-at-what-the-international-media-is-saying-about-the-indo-pak-war-gamesThis is as true as reports stating killingsof 300+No he is not kidding.  Even though Pakistan overall has a worse image in the international community, Pakistan has come out looking like the more sensible state in this specific episode.  India claimed surgical strikes which international community did not object to but then presented no evidence that even 1 militant was killed.  The international social media was retweeting pictures of trees being hit.  Then there were images of Indian jet wreckage and also a live Indian pilot sipping tea with Pakistan army.All this while Imran Khan kept pleading for peace and Modi was making delayed empty statements. Modi's tactics backfired and India lost the PR battle and this is what most articles on western media outlets reflected.  This isn't to say Pakistan overall has the better image around the world, it doesn't but in this instance they came out looking better.  At the very least in the eyes of the international public.Dogfighting is all about positioning.  Whoever gets behind has a massive advantage, even if their aircraft is inferior.  If F-16s were on the run then a Mig 21 can shoot it from behind, same can be said of a Pakistani Mirage shooting down Sukhoi 30 in retreat, it doesn't say much about the pilots capability if that is the case.The denial is extreme. In last two days, slowly but steadily Pakistan's JeM relations are coming out from mouths of their own people and ministers. Wait for a few days, everything will fall apart from your own side.Now since Pakistan has openly confessed their contact with JeM, why don't you tell them to telecast a pre-recorded video of terrorist that India declared dead and taken his name specifically in press conference?No country will share details of their military operations and that includes US who has scarcely given details about their counter terrorist ops in past and present.If Pakistan so staunchly believes that no terrorists are being raised on it's soil, why are you hell bent on asking for a proof?When people are at fault and hide their crimes, they seek for approval from outside.Bruh, I know this is a theory but damn, this makes perfect sense. You good. Let's see if we get more info.&gt;Pakistan denied using F-16s in the operation, said it was JF-17s.I don't think they said it was JF17s, iirc they only said F-16s weren't used. &gt;  ISI story of Col Salim)What is that?I dont know urdu man. If you suspect military action, then the responsible thing to do would be to close civilian airspace wouldn't it?Closing airspace doesn't stop foreign journalists that are already in the country from visiting the site. Which there are likely many of.Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.&gt;Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 daysWhich is miniscule compared to a civilian liner getting shot down by rogue SAM launches.Not everything has to be a conspiracy.&gt; restricted access to the site.It was a terrorist camp, one under Pakistan's nose that it publicly denied. Regardless of it being destroyed or not, Pakistan would not want foreign journalists digging through the place confirming that it was a training camp for terrorists.He said images from commercial satellites.The professor in this video echoed my feelings on this as a westerner observing this from afar.So we should have lied about it when Pakistan had first brought it up?Lol can you imagine the shit show. The Pakistani guy sayng that we invaded their air space and bombed them. Then the Indians denying it outright. Pakistanis coming up with proof. Us denying the proof of the shells or radar too. Are you alright with that scenario?Why should we make fat Joe in America believe in this? If the American state wants to know they'll contact the Indian state and not read new York times. The Pakistanis lied about two planes being shot down. They lied about having two Indian pilots in custody. They lied about only payload bring dropped and no bombs being dropped in the initial tweets. They lied about not using F16 in the raid. They lied in 2016 about those surgical strikes. If you're a congenital liar then don't expect anyone to give you the benefit of the doubt No man they didn't ask for evidence. They said no evidence is provided. It's a very substantial difference. Jaitley explained it too, it negatively affects the operational secrecy of India therefore evidence won't be provided. Maybe it can be provided later like the 2016 strikes which again were doubted by Pakistanis but then they were proven to be liars, again.Our army doesn't need PR and doesn't need to whitewash a bad image, unlike Pakistan.   India officially released the video of 2016 air strikes in 2018.  It's part of strategy and planning, it's not like they'll give you proofs just because a couple of media houses start claiming random stuff.  On what basis do you think you deserve to know the proof while the operation is going on?Read about some doctrines of war. This is not how militaries is the world function. The army shouldn't be forced to do PR work while the situation is so tense. Once the situation calms down, they can decide what to show and what to keep covert, based on what suits them strategically. Makes no sense why not allow international flights, unless foreign carriers doesnt want to fly in yet. What about PIA international flights?I am not sure ( lives in US) but last i checked it was even open during those tense days ( except for three hours). All those things on Wg cmdr Abhinandan's chest are chest leads used to take an ECG. Probably as a part of routine medical checkup.Renal failure or air strikes?CID team at Wagah borderACP Pradhyuman : Daya, darwaza tod do!No need to write the /s , they'll actually do that.CID officer Vivek on the job.

It will hopefully give a clear picture of the national sentiment, Western countries are also keeping mum. LOL! No. Its hard to find something trustworthy but NDTV is not to be trusted for sure. I would be very reserved about generalizing western media when that itself has so many internal divides. Pakistan may have come across as sensible in this particular instance but youre forgetting that the problem leaderships of the world have is with terrorism. Pakistan has not been able to solve the problem! One can be sympathetic to a country only so much and so many times. Even if IK means the change Pakistan is hoping for, the expectations from him are quite crazy. And anyway, international media does not run world leaderships. Frankly who the fuck can thump their chests and say what exactly happened in the strike? No one. Image aside, an aspect of politics that matters clearly seems to operate with facts that arent completely shared with the public it seems.If what Gen. Bakshi says is true then Pakistan needs to be held responsible for war crimes, not invited to ceremonies of prizes. Sat what you may about him, Bakshi has seen war at close quarters and might know a thing or two. Guy on left gives no fucks about war or peace, he just wanna be high and wasted!You are kidding right? Such assumption is baseless and frankly quite stupid on their part. He admitted to being targeted but not that they were hit. This is damning for both countries. It pretty much alludes that India tried but failed to attack their camps and it alludes that Pakistan lies about JeMs presence in the area.&gt;The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc.What the fuck are you going on about? The U.S landed on the moon and Seal Team Six killed Bin Laden. &gt; International media will never want India / Pakistan to come together and solve issues after all we buy most weapons.Stop blaming the international media and the gore log for the problems on the subcontinent. This is a conflict of our own making. Ok but is this standard LOC firing etc? There's not going to be a serious outbreak of war right? Slight digression but I think it would've been terrible to go to war without 42 IAF squadrons ready. Air Force won't lie ..if it's caught it goes under severe scrutiny.

I wouldn't doubt it a second.Mate can you get any sat imagery of Balakot?Yes let me call my friend at CIDThe Indian government is refusing to provide evidence, therefore the Pakistanis are liars.Wah. Just brilliant.I really  like these rajyasabha and losabha channel very calm and informative discussion, big fan of them for sometime now, Nobody is believing the claims from media. IAF has claimed MIG 21 shot down F16. Stop with that jet engine picture story, nobody believes it here. It was cooked up by the media since IAF didn't release any picture.  But IAF claims have so far been true. They stood by that the pak air force used F16 even when your own air force kept denying it.IAF never claimed 300 were dead. Check your sources.Indian media sources are bad. But I am saying IAF official releases. They have been true so far.And I am not even going to talk how your media claimed the AIM 120c5 missile were from taiwan and that Lockheed has sued india for defamation. Taiwan army themselves had to respond to stop the misinformation    Why? What good would that do? Do u think Pakistan govt doesn't know what actually happened? Same with all other world nations. We criticise modi for using this to get votes. He says that the enemy air force bombed their training center where 'students' used to learn jihad to help opressed Kashmiris.He is not wrong. Various Governments knew for over 20 years now that Mig21Bs need to phased out. We still have 113 of them active mate. Embarrassing.&gt; Pick one: The Mig took down a F16 or the Mig is a flying coffinBoth are not mutually exclusive. The Mig21 bison is heavily upgraded with the following - - Russian X-band pulse Doppler radar with slotted array- Russian IRST- European INS and GPS- European MFD- Israeli HUD- New indigenous RWR- Stores management system- Air data computer- Helmet mounted sight- New comms/radios- New canopy (for better pilot visibility)- Ability to fire the R-77 BVRAAM and R-73 WVRAAMIn short, its instantaneous turn rate and acceleration, and the helmet mounted sight combined with R-73 air-to-air missiles make it very effective at close range encounters and interceptions, even against 4.5 gen aircraft. It also has a tremendous advantage because of its low radar visibility. However there is no getting around the fact that its design is obsolete now and it is limited by the capacity of its airframe and needs to be phased out.&gt; Is it a 100% given that a Rafale couldn't have been shot down?Nothing is ever certain in dogfighting but rafale is clearly a vastly superior multirole aircraft. &gt; What result is he talking about?Am assuming he is talking about the loss of our Mig-21 and capture of our pilot. And yes, a more modern aircraft will most likely have improved our chances of success, maybe avoiding the capture of our pilot.hi how may i help youThat is Pak's F16I just gave examples of those two incidents. I do believe in both things but Pakistan never accepted killing of Osama and there are many countries which still doubt moon landing. Good thing is most people in US never doubted in what they were told by govt. Point is Pakistan govt and media can keep denying Osama killing, Surgical strike, air strike, F16 forever but that doesn't change the truth for rest of the world.International media like CNN, BBC are famously associated with certain ideology. I personally find most stories of NYT and WSJ fair and neutral. It is not in business interest of many countries and parties that India, Pakistan become friends and grow together.NDTV is one of the most biased media houses of India but than so is every other channel.News portals have chosen their camps Right, Left or center. Money, power and Ideology being the deciding factor.International media will never want India / Pakistan to come together and solve issues after all we buy most weapons. This kind of difference news game has been always played in past too specifically during war like sceneorios like this one but it looks more today due to social media and reach of internet.The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc.In India not just the airspace is open but world's largest gathering "Kumbh" is going peacefully in Prayagraj, Australia is playing matches peacefully, Hero Football league is going on, Modi, Shah, Rahul are doing election campaign, our PM is not even taking calls from Pakistan.Pak govt has never accepted Osama killing, surgical strikes, for many years Kargil war they will take few decades to accept Air Strike.Number may not be 300 killed at Balakot but if IAF entered in Pak and dropped bombs that is a big deal and changes India's responses to future possible attacks. If govt had done this after Mumbai attacks that would have been best. &gt; the world is thrashing Pakistan the world = his fellow keyboard commandsThat doesn't rule out that they are not.I am starting to get some ideas...his twitter bio clearly states " RTs ` Endorsements  "And then he goes undercover as a fucking terrorist and kills them from within. Then gets caught and dies. Comes back to life when Daya bawls on his chest. MiG-21 is a Light Combat Aircraft. Rafale is Medium, it wont replace it.

India claim to have a kill but there is no proof. But India officialdom didn't claim photo evidence of the F16, internettors did. In your own narrative, F16s are involved so Pak officialdom lied.Did Indian strikes succeed - we don't know. But people in the know point to Pakistan's photos of the craters and trees and say that a \*missed\* explosion from the SPICE 2000 won't just produce a crater, it will defoliate nearby trees. And Pak still hasn't let anyone tour the actual madrasa site, nor zoomed out on the craters they did photo, to show the scale of the explosion. **Edit**: let me put it this way, 10 guys with shovels could have produced those particular "craters" in an hour.In the larger scheme of things, India called the nuclear bluff and attacked Pak territory in response to a terrorist attack that they believe - and the organization JeM took responsibility for - was organized in Pakistan. Will this happen again if there is another attack - I believe so.For me personally, watching that final video of WC Abhinandan put out by Pak officially - seemed like one of those ISIS and Saddam videos where you capture someone and make them sing their captor's praises. I have some colorful language but that would get me banned on this particular sub. Suffice to say it was revolting. Your country just isn't worth the time, for me, anymore.Also the fact that Pakistan did the exact same thing in return as well turned it into a dud.'Al Qaeda is banned, not Osama bin Laden'.What's the point then?&gt; If some substantial thing happens about killing terrorists, etc, media will project it as a success for Modi.And some in social media will project it as being manufactured by Modi / Doval.Common citizens rarely know much about defense matters so most people don't realize the significance or what a bad situation the IAF's inventory is in.Kind of died down except our keyboard warriors and stupid bjp since most of the evidence suggests the airstrikes were a dud and they captured our pilot. The PR went against us after the initial euphoria.Even if it was a dud the fact that IAF went so far into Pak territory and dropped bombs would have been a strong signal nonetheless but the media and the social media warriors have fucked up big time and turned this into a dud. Akshay Kumar should be the hero imoI'd pay to see that. Hi bud, how's work? BTW needed the coordinates for the balakot air strikes, stat.Yes, let me call my friend at NSA.Thank you! :)Can you please post a translation here?

While other channels are relying on information from twitter handles. Ndtv is discussing things through the information provided by Indian defence during press conference.Also please go through IAF press conference on 2nd day with reports published on news channels. You will find out that there is over exaggeration on all the news channels other than NDTV. India is changing narrative from victory to intention. First day govt leaked it to media that around 300 people killed. Next day Indian pilot caught by Pakistan and Indian defence had to do a press briefing in this they claimed its immature to assume casualties. Now international official sources have confirmed that India had intelligence to the target but we did not hit the target. If we have to put fear in Pakistan we have to show our capability by hitting them right on target not by showing our  intent or chest thumping with unverified numbers. And the fact that he thought of swallowing those documents.

It helps us bolster our ego.Why use critical thinking , why look for different sources to corroborate one sides claim.For us blind faith is everything.Tomorrow if Modi comes and tell us that he invaded Pakistan and China  and ask us to just believe him, we will ofcourse do that.Independent international media my foot.because he nearly sacrificed his life for his country."Jo bhi humare masle hai, hum dehshatgardi karwake ke hal karenge" Its hilarious lol.https://www.unionjournalism.com/2019/03/01/pakistan-pilot-killed-by-local-pakistani-thinking-he-was-an-indian-pilot/Chobey ji uth jao subah ho chuki Hain!&gt;Pakistani being killed in jailAre you referring to the Lynched pilot?Anecdotal and not empirical. Indian covert operations are rarely declassified and are more than what meets the eye. Just look at the historical unification of India or the support to LTTE as an example . &amp;#x200B;Do note, I am not saying that the strikes didn't happen or that a building wasn't destroyed. However, I question the loss of life. The strikes in itself is a major step and should be "questionably applauded". But loss of life at 3:30AM?  Remember when the 2016 surgical strikes were carried out, villagers could be quoted saying the area was blocked and many trucks could be seen entering. This time its different - even the villagers are laughing.&gt;Just heard that the body of a Pakistani prisoner has been handed over to Pakistan. Why is there no one talking about it here? Yesterday, a mere delay was linked with ill will of Pakistan towards the release of Abhi.Fake news. IAF has not reported anything on its press release or twitter handle. Do not change speculation into news.  Source: [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/68225068.cms?utm\_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm\_medium=text&amp;utm\_campaign=cppst](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/68225068.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst)  Quote:  The IAF said it will talk to Abhinandan about the video and clarify.  Wow... Nice plot. Will definitely watch that.Must be a Techies spammerDidn't know one could hold sermons while being so ill that you couldn't even get out of a hospital bed .International media's outlook does not matter. The outlook of international governments does. And they have come out in support of India's actions. And if the Indian army claims to have hit whatever they've targeted, I believe that. Not some casualty report of 300 cooked up by the media. I saw it at 1.5 speed and he's still slow. But we are so used to such video footage since the gulf war in the 90s.  Pakis using this opportunity. Im not for war, but whenever there is intel report on training camp in pok  we should attack preemptively and govt shouldnt chest thump it. Did he sleep?OkBut they didn't target our buildings. That's what they announced to the media. Unlike ours. Because god made them that wayYeah , imagine a Boeing carrying bombs like a bomber and a FUCKING BrahMos tipped with a goddamn nuclear warhead for shits and giggles . That is gonna cause some lethal damage my friend >#>#>#>#Some high level banter comments on that thread.
