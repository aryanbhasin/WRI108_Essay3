his twitter bio clearly states " RTs ` Endorsements  "And then he goes undercover as a fucking terrorist and kills them from within. Then gets caught and dies. Comes back to life when Daya bawls on his chest. The thing is that there is no evidence available that IAF hit any of those military camps, so the western media is not believing ithttps://www.newslaundry.com/2019/02/28/a-look-at-what-the-international-media-is-saying-about-the-indo-pak-war-gamesThis is as true as reports stating killingsof 300+Yup why need proof we are people of faith. We believe whatever crap politicians are feeding us. It helps us bolster our ego.Why use critical thinking , why look for different sources to corroborate one sides claim.For us blind faith is everything.Tomorrow if Modi comes and tell us that he invaded Pakistan and China  and ask us to just believe him, we will ofcourse do that.Independent international media my foot.because he nearly sacrificed his life for his country.Our army doesn't need PR and doesn't need to whitewash a bad image, unlike Pakistan.   India officially released the video of 2016 air strikes in 2018.  It's part of strategy and planning, it's not like they'll give you proofs just because a couple of media houses start claiming random stuff.  On what basis do you think you deserve to know the proof while the operation is going on?Read about some doctrines of war. This is not how militaries is the world function. The army shouldn't be forced to do PR work while the situation is so tense. Once the situation calms down, they can decide what to show and what to keep covert, based on what suits them strategically. rofl. Some high level banter comments on that thread.And the fact that he thought of swallowing those documents. Showed real composure throughout. He did not seem to crack under pressure and did his job right. It's really hard to give ABP news credibility after that shit storm they've pulled. All we're saying is that releasing that edited video serves nothing good for either country. And Pakistan would've been in big trouble if they killed the WC.The denial is extreme. In last two days, slowly but steadily Pakistan's JeM relations are coming out from mouths of their own people and ministers. Wait for a few days, everything will fall apart from your own side.Now since Pakistan has openly confessed their contact with JeM, why don't you tell them to telecast a pre-recorded video of terrorist that India declared dead and taken his name specifically in press conference?No country will share details of their military operations and that includes US who has scarcely given details about their counter terrorist ops in past and present.If Pakistan so staunchly believes that no terrorists are being raised on it's soil, why are you hell bent on asking for a proof?When people are at fault and hide their crimes, they seek for approval from outside.world is not trashing pakistan. As far as global media is concerned pakistan came out as the good guys just their video released after abhinandan was in india portrayed them in bad light . Thats why they took down the video from all their media handles. no1 has openly taken sides as things havent escalated to that degreeit aint an excuse to hate. It was all great when it was peace gesture to release him. Releasing a doctored and forced video with 50 cuts is what pissed off people here. There was 0 need for it and moreover added no info that was already known. Worst thing u took interview of our commander in uniform but later was returned in a suit ? Do u know see your fault or still wanna talk here with ur nonsensical facts ?there is no coverage of that news anywhere on indian media. Full disclosure we all hate our media thats why rely on twitter. If its true my heart goes out to u. Thanks!Anecdotal and not empirical. Indian covert operations are rarely declassified and are more than what meets the eye. Just look at the historical unification of India or the support to LTTE as an example . &amp;#x200B;Do note, I am not saying that the strikes didn't happen or that a building wasn't destroyed. However, I question the loss of life. The strikes in itself is a major step and should be "questionably applauded". But loss of life at 3:30AM?  Remember when the 2016 surgical strikes were carried out, villagers could be quoted saying the area was blocked and many trucks could be seen entering. This time its different - even the villagers are laughing.&gt;Just heard that the body of a Pakistani prisoner has been handed over to Pakistan. Why is there no one talking about it here?

Which there are likely many of.Nor does it stop international news agencies from contracting local freelancing reporters.&gt;Imagine monetary lost sustained and inconvenience faced by civilians for halting operations completely for more than 4 daysWhich is miniscule compared to a civilian liner getting shot down by rogue SAM launches.Not everything has to be a conspiracy.&gt; restricted access to the site.It was a terrorist camp, one under Pakistan's nose that it publicly denied. Regardless of it being destroyed or not, Pakistan would not want foreign journalists digging through the place confirming that it was a training camp for terrorists.He said images from commercial satellites.The professor in this video echoed my feelings on this as a westerner observing this from afar.He chased f16/jf17 into enemy territory and shot it down, on a Mig, was caught by enemies beaten up (by civilians) later when questioned blindfolded, shows amazing composure. I am just a keyboard warrior..... I wouldn't know what a hero is made of... but in my limited knowledge that's a hero.  The fact that he probably downed an f16 with an mig,The fact that he managed to survive as long as he did after parachuting into enemy territory,The fact that he refused to divulge any classified information without knowing he was being recorded(as he was blindfolded) knowing full well that he was going to be tortured or probably killed for it,The fact that after being through so much in so less time he didn't loose his composure and the cuts in the propaganda video might mean that he didn't exactly say everything that the enemy would've wanted him to say.Bhai they completely ignored your point.  Koi faida nahi. Not one person spoke about the murdered Pakistani.  Everyone is worried about the 5 hour delay. Inko apnay haal pay rehne deyMakes perfect sense. But in the end, people would say anything to one up each other and ignore the main point. Nobody thinks anything of the murdered Pakistani. Lmao they keep ignoring youIt wasn't the delay. It was the heavily edited video that came out moments before his release. Don't know why Pakistan felt it needed to do it. Lost a lot of goodwill as a result. &gt; Why does the video matter so much when the guy can contradict with that as soon as he is going to cross over?  Look, I was the first to mention that there were a lot of Pakistanis asking that Abhinandan be treated well. I was genuinely moved by it. But, moments before his release, there's this  video - where it looks like he's been coerced - so you start to feel that you can't really trust Pakistan. On one hand there's talk of peace gesture and on the other there's manipulation.I understand your point. Plus, I don't think its worth going to war over. My feeling about it is to the extent that I can't trust everything Pakistan says. I will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution.  We are thankful that he's back home. There's a lot of one-upping going on here and having a reasonable debate will be hard. Again, I am thankful Pakistan released him, but the video did do a damage to the trust of even the faithfully liberal person.&amp;#x200B;https://m.timesofindia.com/india/indian-jets-hit-school-of-jihad-says-azhars-brother-in-audio/articleshow/68238334.cmshttps://m.timesofindia.com/india/indian-jets-hit-school-of-jihad-says-azhars-brother-in-audio/articleshow/68238334.cmsFrom horses mouth..https://m.timesofindia.com/india/indian-jets-hit-school-of-jihad-says-azhars-brother-in-audio/articleshow/68238334.cmshttps://m.timesofindia.com/india/indian-jets-hit-school-of-jihad-says-azhars-brother-in-audio/articleshow/68238334.cmsPakistani here. He did not shoot down any of our jets. These are just claims by your media without any proof. The only proof that was bought up was a picture of a destroyed jet engine, that too was debunked by a specialist on India today. Regardless, he is still a hero as he fought for his country and you guys should be proud of him.Uhhh what ? Our army never claimed or did any surgical strikes in 2016. That was your army (that claimed to do so that too without any proof much like this time) in retaliation to an attack that they blamed on Pakistan (similarly without any proof, what you said about the leopard is true after all).I don't bring up local and biased news sources because they do just that. Make BS up to glorify their nation. And you did exactly that. Regardless it's very much possible that this strike did happen and our forces are lying, I'm ready to entertain this possibility even with the proof being shady at best. Hoping your public would do so too.Which one ? They lied about the air strike 300 dead bodies were 3 trees at best. Every single international and neutral report indicates that no damage was done to the madrassah in the area. Hell, they didn't even make it to Balakot.It's funny because I'm living in the country where the army has major influence on media and how our history is written, but even then we are skeptical of their claims and whenever they try to feed us some bs. Your public doesn't even seem to be questioning this whole fiasco.&gt; &gt; People don't know if u see any pak news channel the bullshit they show with literacy rate 78%(i think so) the propaganda works wonder there wheare as we doubt our mediaThey should put out something spread it into Pakistan so the fake news get's counteredhow do google maps satellite imaging work is it on a cycle or somethinglet's wait and probably we can compare Akshay Kumar should be the hero imoI'd pay to see that. Wow...

Where in the video did those two things happen?I saw it at 1.5 speed and he's still slow. Makes no sense why not allow international flights, unless foreign carriers doesnt want to fly in yet. What about PIA international flights?I am not sure ( lives in US) but last i checked it was even open during those tense days ( except for three hours). The Indian foreign minister said ['a very large number of people were killed](https://youtu.be/Gj3qqBf2e4s?t=129).However this has been proving wrong by [satellite imagery](https://medium.com/dfrlab/surgical-strike-in-pakistan-a-botched-operation-7f6cda834b24) +[BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xtXnS9Fw6g) +[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-kashmir-pakistan-scene-idUSKCN1QF13U)+ [Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/indian-air-raid-site-casualties-mysterious-madrassa-190227183058957.html) No damage to any of the buildings, unless the bomb teleported through the roof, it's confirmed fakeThe [washington post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/modi-india-no-longer-helpless-in-face-of-terror-after-crisis-with-pakistan/2019/03/01/31d6667c-3c20-11e9-b786-d6abcbcd212a_story.html?utm_term=.af56065dc5f8) says: *'India said the strikes eliminated large numbers of militants but has provided no proof. Satellite imagery of the site has undermined Indias claims that it hit its intended target and caused serious casualties.'*This supports pakistan's claim that only a few trees were damaged and no one kiled, and suggest the indian foreign minister was lying. The reason they aren't releasing evidence is because it shows they liedYou do realize youre advocating for a solution that would likely kill a billion, if not two billion, right? Pakistan should be fighting against the terrorists it allows and encourages to operate against India. But there is no solution, except diplomacy, that wouldnt kill millions. A better solution would be to isolate Pakistan. Encourage the rest of the world to recognize Pakistan as a sponsor of terrorism. Boycott and cut them off. Make them a pariah state that they should have been after 9/11. Sure, theyll lash out with more attacks. But eventually (hopefully) their citizens will push for their government to do something about the camps on their soil. But military action against Pakistan will lead to untold suffering in both countries. War wont make it better, just much worse and faster. Nobody is believing the claims from media. IAF has claimed MIG 21 shot down F16. Stop with that jet engine picture story, nobody believes it here. It was cooked up by the media since IAF didn't release any picture.  But IAF claims have so far been true. They stood by that the pak air force used F16 even when your own air force kept denying it.IAF never claimed 300 were dead. Check your sources.Indian media sources are bad. But I am saying IAF official releases. They have been true so far.And I am not even going to talk how your media claimed the AIM 120c5 missile were from taiwan and that Lockheed has sued india for defamation. Taiwan army themselves had to respond to stop the misinformation    I'm Pakistani. It's still partially closed. Some airports are open for domestic flights, but no international flights have yet been allowed. It's being said that normal flight operations will resume from 4th March. It should. I have a lot of relatives that are stuck ._. No international flights at all. It's kinda worrisome tho, at least for me. I don't think we're on high alert anymore except LoC. So why close the entire country's airspace? What about India? Is the airspace completely open?Man I really don't know why it's closed lelI'm a normal guy who's afraid of dying. Fuel shortage? O.o who's saying that? There isn't no fuel shortage, not any that I'm aware of. You got any links to where people are saying that?So we should have lied about it when Pakistan had first brought it up?Lol can you imagine the shit show. The Pakistani guy sayng that we invaded their air space and bombed them. Then the Indians denying it outright. Pakistanis coming up with proof. Us denying the proof of the shells or radar too. Are you alright with that scenario?Why should we make fat Joe in America believe in this? If the American state wants to know they'll contact the Indian state and not read new York times. The Pakistanis lied about two planes being shot down. They lied about having two Indian pilots in custody. They lied about only payload bring dropped and no bombs being dropped in the initial tweets. They lied about not using F16 in the raid. They lied in 2016 about those surgical strikes. If you're a congenital liar then don't expect anyone to give you the benefit of the doubt No man they didn't ask for evidence. They said no evidence is provided. It's a very substantial difference. Jaitley explained it too, it negatively affects the operational secrecy of India therefore evidence won't be provided. Maybe it can be provided later like the 2016 strikes which again were doubted by Pakistanis but then they were proven to be liars, again.Did he sleep?Ok*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** chaha-pohe! ^(hug)Standard procedure for any law enforcement agency anywhere in the world is to close down the scene of crime to prevent contamination and a multitude of other things.You're clutching at straws here. Thank you! :)Can you please post a translation here?

Lets just respect his valor and the imagine the happiness in his family that hes back - everything is bullshit for us people to talk about!Every armed forces personnel knows that when you get battle ready, there is a price to pay. We citizens should just be so grateful that we continue to live our lives as chickens because these brave hearts live their lives like that.&gt;  ISI story of Col Salim)What is that?International media's outlook does not matter. The outlook of international governments does. And they have come out in support of India's actions. And if the Indian army claims to have hit whatever they've targeted, I believe that. Not some casualty report of 300 cooked up by the media. Yes Pakistan has a lot of goodwill in Turkey for historical reasons. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PakistanTurkey_relationsThe air forces haven't made any specific claims other that "they achieved their objectives". The questioning is targeting the claims made by the BJP government which has consistently been lying to the country ever since they came into power. After all the false claims regarding demonetization, GDP, etc I think it's fair to not trust them. Make a separate post of this for better visibility.Didn't know one could hold sermons while being so ill that you couldn't even get out of a hospital bed .He admitted to being targeted but not that they were hit. This is damning for both countries. It pretty much alludes that India tried but failed to attack their camps and it alludes that Pakistan lies about JeMs presence in the area.Mate, he plays games to escape real life. why make him do the same in games as well?No he is not kidding.  Even though Pakistan overall has a worse image in the international community, Pakistan has come out looking like the more sensible state in this specific episode.  India claimed surgical strikes which international community did not object to but then presented no evidence that even 1 militant was killed.  The international social media was retweeting pictures of trees being hit.  Then there were images of Indian jet wreckage and also a live Indian pilot sipping tea with Pakistan army.All this while Imran Khan kept pleading for peace and Modi was making delayed empty statements. Modi's tactics backfired and India lost the PR battle and this is what most articles on western media outlets reflected.  This isn't to say Pakistan overall has the better image around the world, it doesn't but in this instance they came out looking better.  At the very least in the eyes of the international public.Dogfighting is all about positioning.  Whoever gets behind has a massive advantage, even if their aircraft is inferior.  If F-16s were on the run then a Mig 21 can shoot it from behind, same can be said of a Pakistani Mirage shooting down Sukhoi 30 in retreat, it doesn't say much about the pilots capability if that is the case.1000kg bomb is true, except it was 907kg(spice 2000 bomb from Israel)Slight digression but I think it would've been terrible to go to war without 42 IAF squadrons ready. Hi bud, how's work? BTW needed the coordinates for the balakot air strikes, stat.Yes, let me call my friend at NSA.Plus helped the Jadhav case become stronger. In that case video evidence was actually asked for. Pick one: The Mig took down a F16 or the Mig is a flying coffin. What result is he talking about? Is it a 100% given that a Rafale couldn't have been shot down?Hindi news channels: Hamare sapoot ka lie detector test kiya gaya... /sa rival hindi channel: aisa lagta hai unhe current laga ke torture kiya gaya hai... /sSometimes yearsYes, let me call my friend at MOSSAD.Yes, let me call my friend at FBI.If there's any such known public service people would have already jumped on it and shared images on twitter. Yes, let me call my friend at CIA.Yes let me call my friend at CIDI am starting to get some ideas...He is not wrong. Various Governments knew for over 20 years now that Mig21Bs need to phased out. We still have 113 of them active mate. Embarrassing.&gt; Pick one: The Mig took down a F16 or the Mig is a flying coffinBoth are not mutually exclusive. The Mig21 bison is heavily upgraded with the following - - Russian X-band pulse Doppler radar with slotted array- Russian IRST- European INS and GPS- European MFD- Israeli HUD- New indigenous RWR- Stores management system- Air data computer- Helmet mounted sight- New comms/radios- New canopy (for better pilot visibility)- Ability to fire the R-77 BVRAAM and R-73 WVRAAMIn short, its instantaneous turn rate and acceleration, and the helmet mounted sight combined with R-73 air-to-air missiles make it very effective at close range encounters and interceptions, even against 4.5 gen aircraft. It also has a tremendous advantage because of its low radar visibility. However there is no getting around the fact that its design is obsolete now and it is limited by the capacity of its airframe and needs to be phased out.&gt; Is it a 100% given that a Rafale couldn't have been shot down?Nothing is ever certain in dogfighting but rafale is clearly a vastly superior multirole aircraft. &gt; What result is he talking about?Am assuming he is talking about the loss of our Mig-21 and capture of our pilot. And yes, a more modern aircraft will most likely have improved our chances of success, maybe avoiding the capture of our pilot.But we are so used to such video footage since the gulf war in the 90s.  Pakis using this opportunity. Im not for war, but whenever there is intel report on training camp in pok  we should attack preemptively and govt shouldnt chest thump it. "Jo bhi humare masle hai, hum dehshatgardi karwake ke hal karenge" Its hilarious lol.Air Force won't lie ..if it's caught it goes under severe scrutiny. People lose jobs .. if it's unsuccessful they would just say that.  There are things that surely we should be critical about and ask proof for but not this. I support Air Force and I believe what they announced. I don't care if you guys think I am bakth or whatever ..I completely trust my Army and I rely on them ..hell I am sleeping well tonight based on same trust. I wouldn't doubt it a second.Mate can you get any sat imagery of Balakot?&gt;The truth of this may never come out just like Osama case or US moon landing etc.What the fuck are you going on about? The U.S landed on the moon and Seal Team Six killed Bin Laden. &gt; International media will never want India / Pakistan to come together and solve issues after all we buy most weapons.Stop blaming the international media and the gore log for the problems on the subcontinent. This is a conflict of our own making. Ok but is this standard LOC firing etc? There's not going to be a serious outbreak of war right? I wrote a wall of text in response and deleted it as pointless. India claim to have a kill but there is no proof. But India officialdom didn't claim photo evidence of the F16, internettors did. In your own narrative, F16s are involved so Pak officialdom lied.Did Indian strikes succeed - we don't know. But people in the know point to Pakistan's photos of the craters and trees and say that a \*missed\* explosion from the SPICE 2000 won't just produce a crater, it will defoliate nearby trees. And Pak still hasn't let anyone tour the actual madrasa site, nor zoomed out on the craters they did photo, to show the scale of the explosion. **Edit**: let me put it this way, 10 guys with shovels could have produced those particular "craters" in an hour.In the larger scheme of things, India called the nuclear bluff and attacked Pak territory in response to a terrorist attack that they believe - and the organization JeM took responsibility for - was organized in Pakistan. Will this happen again if there is another attack - I believe so.For me personally, watching that final video of WC Abhinandan put out by Pak officially - seemed like one of those ISIS and Saddam videos where you capture someone and make them sing their captor's praises. I have some colorful language but that would get me banned on this particular sub. Suffice to say it was revolting. Your country just isn't worth the time, for me, anymore.Bruh, I know this is a theory but damn, this makes perfect sense. You good. Let's see if we get more info.&gt;Pakistan denied using F-16s in the operation, said it was JF-17s.I don't think they said it was JF17s, iirc they only said F-16s weren't used. I mean let's be real, he wasn't there for a peace mission.Why with all India military,intelligence capability and resources couldn't they just "import" all this key individual to India to be trial or if it too hard to get them out then just send them all to a good night "sleep".Who is "thrashing" Pakistan ?hahaha this made my dayIt was Pakistan who first broke the news of India's air strike, not India. First get your facts straight and then talk.Looks like you are really smart. How would you have explained Pakistan's retaliation? &gt; the world is thrashing Pakistan the world = his fellow keyboard commandsCredits go to u/DegnerOsholdIf you listen to the clip, he says the camp was targeted. He does not say they were hit.The Indian government is refusing to provide evidence, therefore the Pakistanis are liars.Wah. Just brilliant.Kind of died down except our keyboard warriors and stupid bjp since most of the evidence suggests the airstrikes were a dud and they captured our pilot. The PR went against us after the initial euphoria.Even if it was a dud the fact that IAF went so far into Pak territory and dropped bombs would have been a strong signal nonetheless but the media and the social media warriors have fucked up big time and turned this into a dud. [https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976](https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101992269060734976)Even, as per this report [https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf), the firing / tension in LoC to continue until May elections.

The anchor tries to pin the 300 number on the government which is not true and talks like the civilians are entitled a briefing on a military operation.

Ndtv is discussing things through the information provided by Indian defence during press conference.Also please go through IAF press conference on 2nd day with reports published on news channels. You will find out that there is over exaggeration on all the news channels other than NDTV. India is changing narrative from victory to intention. First day govt leaked it to media that around 300 people killed. Next day Indian pilot caught by Pakistan and Indian defence had to do a press briefing in this they claimed its immature to assume casualties. Now international official sources have confirmed that India had intelligence to the target but we did not hit the target. If we have to put fear in Pakistan we have to show our capability by hitting them right on target not by showing our  intent or chest thumping with unverified numbers. I really  like these rajyasabha and losabha channel very calm and informative discussion, big fan of them for sometime now, recording to Mai bhi bana sakta hun.Sad :(Stop spammingLooks like they're really sweeping out the terrorists, sleeper cells, it is a difficult situation to people of Kashmir.Also the fact that Pakistan did the exact same thing in return as well turned it into a dud.hi how may i help youHe says that the enemy air force bombed their training center where 'students' used to learn jihad to help opressed Kashmiris.But they didn't target our buildings.
